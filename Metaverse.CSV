Las acciones restantes del capital de Ultra Srl fueron suscritas, en el 15%, por particulares interesados en la oportunidad de invertir en la iniciativa y, en el 30%, por profesionales activos en la realización de los proyectos que constituirán la actividad principal de la empresa.

La empresa diseñará, desarrollará y comercializará productos y servicios destinados a posibilitar experiencias inmersivas dentro de espacios virtuales privados o mundos sociales virtuales (metaversos), es decir, aplicaciones de software que pueden funcionar de forma autónoma en dispositivos dedicados y entornos virtuales dirigidos a plataformas hoy atribuibles a los modelos metaverso privado y metaverso público.

Tal y como explica la compañía, este mercado se caracteriza por sus ""enormes perspectivas de desarrollo"". De hecho, el metaverso puede constituir la próxima generación de Internet, en la que el mundo físico y el virtual se combinan de forma persistente e inmersiva. Un metaverso independiente de los dispositivos, accesible a través de ordenadores, consolas de juegos y teléfonos inteligentes, podría dar lugar a un vasto ecosistema. Citigroup estima que el mercado total al que se puede dirigir el metaverso podría crecer, a nivel mundial, entre 8 y 13 billones de dólares para 2030.

La cadena de valor del metaverso consta de siete niveles: experiencias, plataformas de adecuación de la oferta y la demanda, sistemas de creación y distribución de contenidos, sistemas informáticos, tecnologías de descentralización, interfaces e infraestructuras. Ultra pretende abordar específicamente la primera de estas siete capas, es decir, la capa de servicios que permiten las experiencias. A modo de ejemplo, se pueden mencionar los siguientes dominios o casos de uso experienciales, todos ellos con un enorme potencial de negocio: colaboración empresarial y trabajo inteligente, educación, arquitectura, museos, ferias, juegos, comercio electrónico, inmobiliaria, turismo, entretenimiento, fitness.

Ultra tiene previsto dirigirse a dos segmentos de mercado:

1.- La industria en general, interesada en la creación de entornos virtuales para apoyar la mejora de la marca, la comunicación, la formación y en cualquier otro contexto.

2.- GLAM, es decir, galerías, bibliotecas, archivos, museos e instituciones públicas y privadas que operan en el ámbito de la valorización del patrimonio cultural y artístico y de los productos del ingenio humano.

Desde el punto de vista del Grupo, resulta especialmente interesante la posibilidad de utilizar la realidad virtual para dar vida a modelos digitales de un producto, una máquina o una fábrica en el contexto de la Industria 4.0. De hecho, a través de su unidad aHead Research, este firma es referenter en la construcción de modelos de simulación de los elementos físicos y conceptuales de un sistema, realizados mediante la generación e introducción de variables aleatorias para realizar análisis WHAT-IF.

""La integración de la simulación y la realidad virtual es fundamental en la perspectiva del gemelo digital, es decir, la representación digital de un almacén o cadena de suministro, conectada en tiempo real con la realidad física. El gemelo digital permite entender cómo mover eficientemente las mercancías mediante la simulación de rutas de envío, o definir la mejor colocación de los productos en las estanterías y la disposición óptima del almacén. Se trata de un mercado que podría alcanzar un valor de 540.000 millones de dólares en 2025"", señala esta compañía.

El equipo de Ultra incluirá expertos en arquitectura y diseño, así como técnicos con conocimientos de modelado y desarrollo en 3D. Al frente del equipo estarán Valentina Temporin y John Volpato -con las funciones de presidente y director general, respectivamente-, que llevan diseñando y realizando experiencias de realidad virtual y escenarios metaversos desde 2018.

""Más allá de los flechazos fáciles del momento, vemos en el mundo de los metaversos experiencias virtuales inmersivas y aplicaciones de RV, RA e híbridas un potencial de cambio de juego de enorme alcance"", afirma Giulia Gestri, presidenta de Spindox. ""Es importante estar ahí desde el principio, en un momento en el que se experimentan nuevas tecnologías, pero sobre todo se consolidan los modelos de negocio"", añade.

""Entramos en el negocio de la realidad inmersiva con un posicionamiento muy claro: queremos apoyar a las empresas, compañías culturales, marcas e instituciones a lo largo de todo el ciclo de vida en la transición hacia la virtualización y el metaverso. En los mundos virtuales de Ultra, la calidad del diseño del espacio se funde con una fluida traducción, interpretación y organización de los contenidos para dar vida a experiencias que desencadenen relaciones comerciales y de networking y estimulen el crecimiento colectivo y las conexiones sociales. Las experiencias creadas serán coherentes con los objetivos empresariales identificados, capaces de aportar valor y efectivamente integradas con todos los demás puntos de contacto"", apunta por su parte Valentina Temporin, presidenta de Ultra.";{'uri': 'foodretail.es', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'foodretail'}
1;;"Il programma dell'edizione 2022 di LuBeC - Lucca Beni Culturali, l'incontro internazionale di Promo PA Fondazione, che si terrà il 6 e 7 ottobre al Real Collegio di Lucca

La XVIII edizione di LuBeC - Lucca Beni Culturali, l'incontro internazionale di Promo PA Fondazione dedicato a cultura e innovazione, si terrà il 6 e 7 ottobre al Real Collegio di Lucca, con la direzione di Francesca Velani (lubec.it).

Due giorni intensi di appuntamenti, tutti gratuiti e disponibili anche in streaming sul canale YouTube di LuBeC, con partner nazionali e internazionali, che vedranno direttori dei principali musei d'Italia e del mondo, economisti, scrittori, filosofi, artisti, amministratori, dirigenti, operatori ed esperti del settore confrontarsi in quello che, da 18 anni, è l'appuntamento cardine, a livello nazionale, del dibattito tra pubblica amministrazione, impresa e terzo settore, luogo di aggregazione e accumulazione culturale, generatore di azioni per lo sviluppo territoriale a base culturale.

LuBeC è un laboratorio di idee nel quale l'incontro tra pubblico e privato favorisce la nascita di progetti condivisi in campo socio-culturale ed economico e strategie d'intervento concreto, necessarie per far fronte alle sfide sociali ed ecologiche del presente.

La manifestazione metterà l'innovazione - dei processi, dei prodotti, delle tecnologie e della società - al centro delle riflessioni sul presente e sul prossimo futuro, approfondendo il ruolo della cultura come motore della transizione e l'attuazione del PNRR in tutte le misure che interagiscono con la cultura. Saranno presentati e messi a confronto progetti, visioni, strumenti e risultati su temi che vanno dal rapporto tra cultura e metacultura al ruolo dei musei nel futuro, dalla rinnovata alleanza con il design e l'industria alla rigenerazione sociale e culturale dei borghi, dall'accessibilità all'ibridazione dei generi per la crescita delle imprese culturali e creative, fino ai nuovi autori e nuovi pubblici per lo spettacolo dal vivo.

""LuBeC è la vetrina del cambiamento - dichiara Gaetano Scognamiglio, Presidente di Promo PA Fondazione - Fruizioni e valorizzazione dei beni culturali si evolvono velocemente e così anche tutto il mondo che ruota intorno alla cultura. La scorsa settimana, per fare un esempio, la settima edizione di wop art a Lugano ha accolto accanto alle opere su carta opere su NFT, aprendo un dibattito su rapporto fra carta e digitale in un futuro assai vicino. I musei ormai sono aperti al digitale e la fruizione delle opere avviene attraverso percorsi esperienziali con tecnologie immersive. Ai riferimenti tradizionali dei grandi attrattori culturali lentamente si stanno affiancando opere e beni culturali che vengono riscoperti anche grazie alla valorizzazione dei borghi che diventano neo-luoghi dove addirittura andare a vivere e poter lavorare a distanza. Di questo e di altre ""mutazioni"" si parlerà nella diciottesima edizione di LuBeC che ospita nuovamente ISIE, il summit internazionale su quanto c'è di nuovo nel mondo in materia di immersività"".

Per accompagnare il cambiamento, gettare solide basi per il futuro e per il lavoro dei giovani, occorre conoscere a fondo il potenziale del binomio cultura-digitale. Durante la due-giorni torna, dopo il successo della scorsa edizione, ISIE - International Summit of Immersive Experience, dedicato alla pluralità delle esperienze che possono essere vissute a livello intellettuale e sensoriale tra mondi reali e digitali.

Tema della seconda edizione del Summit sarà Musei del futuro, una riflessione con le voci più importanti del panorama italiano e internazionale su come le istituzioni museali adatteranno la propria offerta culturale al linguaggio digitale, sulle possibilità offerte dal metaverso e la nuova produzione creativa che in tale ambiente si sviluppa, su rischi e opportunità di questo nuovo paradigma. Nato in ambito cyberpunk e tornato al centro delle discussioni in tempi recenti dopo gli annunci di Facebook e di altre aziende tech, il metaverso apre a una pluralità di esperienze da vivere a livello emotivo, fisico, intellettuale e sensoriale: in termini di edutainment, le soluzioni per i musei sono pressoché illimitate.

""L'evoluzione è una sintesi fra progresso e tradizione, è spingere in avanti la storia attraverso tecnologia e creatività, veicolare la comunicazione nella logica della diffusione del sapere - afferma Mario Pardini, sindaco di Lucca. La sfida del nostro tempo sta nella valorizzazione e capitalizzazione del nostro immenso patrimonio culturale attraverso mezzi digitali e metodi scientifici, per raggiungere una fruizione più ampia abbattendo le tradizionali barriere analogiche, ma senza abbandonare il valore aggiunto dell'esperienza classica. Tutto questo è LuBeC, l'evento che ci insegna quanto sia importante ripartire dalla cultura, intesa come humus fondamentale e motore di crescita primario della nostra società"".

""La cultura è oggi riconosciuta dai policy makers come driver per lo sviluppo sostenibile e fattore determinate per affrontare le pressioni e i bisogni economici, sociali ed ecologici del nostro tempo, stimolo da un lato all'innovazione e alla competitività, e dall'altro alla partecipazione e alla coesione sociale - aggiunge Francesca Velani. Per mettere a terra questa visione servono politiche e progettualità dedicate allo sviluppo a base culturale, fondate su di una reale collaborazione pubblico-privato, e LuBeC rappresenta il luogo in cui è possibile condividere le idee e le soluzioni per vincere questa sfida. Ciò che saremo in grado realizzare oggi, insieme, sarà il nostro patrimonio dopo il Recovery Plan, e potremo considerarlo davvero un investimento se avremo investito nelle persone e costruito modelli produttivi mettendo in dialogo la cultura e creatività con ambiente, sviluppo locale, salute e coesione sociale, occupazione e benessere"".

GLI HIGHLIGHTS DEL PROGRAMMA

LuBeC dà il via alla sua riflessione con un incontro sul tema Cultura, metacultura e nuove alleanze, aperto da Eugenio Giani, Governatore della Regione Toscana con Angela Acordon, Soprintendente Archeologia, Belle Arti e Paesaggio Lucca e Massa Carrara, e introdotto da Gaetano Scognamiglio.

Cultura e metaverso: scenari e competenze è il focus affidato a Christian Greco, Direttore del Museo Egizio di Torino, che si confronta con il pioniere della Data Science e dei Big Data Dino Pedreschi, direttore del KDD LAB (Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Laboratory), centro di ricerca congiunto fra l'Università di Pisa e l'Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione del CNR; e con l'architetto Alessandra Vittorini, Direttore della Fondazione Scuola dei Beni e delle Attività Culturali, cui è affidato il rinnovamento delle competenze del sistema culturale nazionale.

Il punto sugli investimenti del PNRR per le città sarà fatto dall'economista Gustavo Piga, co-founder di OrEP-Osservatorio sul Recovery Plan; insieme a Rocco De Nicola, Rettore della Scuola IMT Alti Studi di Lucca; Angelantonio Orlando, Responsabile Unità di Missione e attuazione del PNRR del MiC; Francesco Profumo, Presidente di ACRI, e Matteo Ricci, Sindaco di Pesaro, Capitale Italiana della Cultura 2024.

L'altro per i piccoli comuni della Linea B, che vedrà la presentazione nazionale del bando da 200 milioni di euro dedicato alle Imprese che nei borghi vorranno insediarsi, a confronto con Giampiero Marchesi, Presidente della Commissione Bando Borghi Linea B, Luigi Scaroina, e alcuni sindaci di borghi selezionati dal bando, in rappresentanza delle istanze degli oltre 240 vincitori provenienti da tutto il Paese.

Sulle Imprese Culturali e Creative ancora opportunità in arrivo dal PNRR, e con esse anche l'urgenza di definire le competenze necessarie per sostenere la richiesta di innovazione che si leva sempre più forte dai settori culturali tradizionali, dalle arti performative, dal design sino all'architettura e alla moda. LuBeC sarà quindi occasione per proporre modalità di trasformazione delle competenze anche in vista del bando da 155 milioni di euro in prossima uscita e destinato al sistema delle ICC: ne discuteranno, con il coordinamento di Angelo Argento, Presidente di Cultura Italiae, Onofrio Cutaia, Vittorio Fresa, Service Unit Cultura Crea INVITALIA; Ugo Bacchella, fondatore di Fondazione Fitzcarraldo; Giovanna Barni, Presidente dell'Associazione Cultura Turismo e Comunicazione di Lega Coop; Matteo Bagnasco, responsabile Obiettivo Cultura Fondazione Compagnia di San Paolo; Umberto Croppi, Direttore Federculture e Marco Tortoioli Ricci, Presidente di AIAP (Associazione italiana design della comunicazione visiva).

ISIE - International Summit of Immersive Experience

L'immersività amplifica e modula l'impatto dei messaggi culturali, facendo vivere all'utente esperienze multisensoriali: che si tratti di ologrammi 3D; di realtà aumentata o di realtà virtuale, l'immersività è una vera e propria espressione artistica, con un linguaggio autonomo e infinite possibilità di applicazione, dal gaming al settore museale. Momento cardine di riflessione sulle potenzialità e i rischi del binomio ormai inscindibile tra digitale e cultura è il Summit Internazionale sull'Immersività: il focus del 2022 sarà Musei del futuro, declinato in tre panel.

Il primo su un confronto internazionale sulle strategie culturali, fra tradizione e linguaggi contemporanei, introdotto e condotto dall'esperto di tecnologia Luca De Biase e dall'artista e videodesigner Stefano Fake. Ospite d'eccezione il filologo, designer e storico statunitense della Harvard University Jeffrey Schnapp, pioniere in molti campi di ricerca transdisciplinare, tra cui l'umanistica digitale, che discuterà con Roberto Ferrari, direttore del Museo della Scienza e della tecnica di Firenze; David Gallo, CEO dell'etichetta videoludica One-O-One Games, inserito da Startupitalia fra le 170 persone da seguire nel mondo dei videogiochi; l'esperta di arte e tecnologia Serena Tabacchi, Direttrice e co-fondatrice del Museum of Contemporary Digital Art (MoCDA), nato a Londra nel 2019 per esporre opere d'arte digitale; Adele Maresca Compagna, Presidente ICOM Italia, il principale network italiano di musei e professionisti museali, con più di 2000 soci, associato all'UNESCO; lo storico e filosofo della scienza Stefano Moriggi, che da anni studia le relazioni tra scienza, filosofia e società; Tiziana Maffei, Direttrice della Reggia di Caserta.

Le ricerche

Promo PA Fondazione, in collaborazione con la Direzione Generale Spettacolo del MiC e AGIS (Associazione Generale Italiana dello Spettacolo) ha realizzato una ricerca sulla nuova autorialità under 35 nello spettacolo dal vivo. A partire dai risultati evidenziati dalla ricerca, un panel per comprendere quali politiche e azioni mettere in campo nei prossimi anni, con Francesca Velani, curatrice della ricerca; Elena Pianea; Ada Montellanico, Vice Presidente del Consiglio Superiore dello Spettacolo del MiC; la ricercatrice Francesca Dell'Omodarme; Rosa Maria di Giorgi, Deputata VII Commissione (Cultura, Scienza, Istruzione) della Camera dei Deputati; Luciano Messi, Presidente ATIT (Associazione Nazionale Teatri di Tradizione); Antonio Parente, Direttore Generale Spettacolo Ministero della Cultura; Francesco Giambrone, Presidente ANFOLS (Associazione Nazionale Fondazioni Lirico-Sinfoniche); Luigi Cristoforetti, Direttore generale e artistico della Fondazione Nazionale della Danza/Aterballetto; Ruggero Sintoni, Presidente ANTAC (Associazione Nazionale dei Teatri Stabili d'Arte Contemporanea); Cristina Scaletti, Presidente Fondazione Toscana Spettacolo.

Una seconda ricerca dedicata ad Art Bonus, che Promo PA Fondazione sta svolgendo con MiC e Ales, sarà spunto per delineare, a partire dai primi dati raccolti, l'evoluzione dei rapporti tra mecenati e beneficiari in termini di radicamento territoriale e consolidamento e continuità delle erogazioni, ma anche per proporre nuove istanze sulla legge.

Infine, l'accessibilità, pilastro e strumento per l'inclusione, per la formazione di comunità aperte e inclusive. La cultura deve essere accessibile per tutti: per ogni età e non solo per le persone con disabilità o svantaggi socio-culturali, ma per chi parla lingue diverse, proviene da culture diverse, così come diversa capacità o sensibilità: a partire da una ricerca della Regione Emilia Romagna con Promo PA Fondazione, Accessibilità: azioni di sistema a supporto dei luoghi della cultura dopo il PNRR, a LuBeC si svolgerà un incontro sulle politiche che le Regioni possono sviluppare insieme per dare alle imprese e agli enti della cultura gli strumenti per rendere la cultura sempre più accessibile, una cultura ""4all"".

gli approfondimenti e gli indirizzi del Ministero della cultura

Una sezione speciale sarà curata dal Ministero della Cultura, con direttori di musei, soprintendenti e responsabili di progetti che si alterneranno in tre panel: Gestione, valorizzazione e accessibilità tra PNRR, cultura e progetti europei, sugli interventi per il miglioramento dell'accessibilità, della sicurezza, e sulla transizione ""verde"" e digitale; Collaborazione pubblico-privato per la valorizzazione e la fruizione del patrimonio culturale, sull'alleanza pubblico-privato per nuovi modelli di gestione e valorizzazione del patrimonio culturale; Valorizzazione del patrimonio: tra sostenibilità ambientale e cambiamento climatico, un'occasione per affrontare il binomio patrimonio culturale/sostenibilità, in linea con gli obiettivi dell'Agenda 2030. Sempre a cura del Ministero della Cultura, il laboratorio Gamification nei luoghi della cultura illustrerà le opportunità divulgative dei game ideati e realizzati per i musei.

Fondazione Scuola dei beni e delle attività culturali curerà due appuntamenti: Come si misura la cultura? Il manuale per navigare tra dati, fonti e indicatori per discutere dell'importanza delle fonti per conoscere, decidere e gestire i beni culturali, e Professioni per il patrimonio culturale. Strumenti e metodi per la formazione a distanza.

LuBeC ospiterà un incontro degli Stati Generali della Cultura della Regione Toscana, momento di ascolto del territorio sul tema del welfare culturale e le politiche per i prossimi anni sul tema, con la consigliera regionale Cristina Giachi; Elena Pianea; Catterina Seia, Presidente CCW - Cultural Welfare Center; Sabrina Iommi, ricercatrice IRPET; Cristina Ambrosini, Responsabile Settore Patrimonio culturale di Regione Emilia Romagna; Carlo Andorlini, CH-Community Hub Culture Ibride; Rita Soccio, Coordinatrice Rete Welfare Culturale Marche.

3;;"La XVIII edizione di LuBeC - Lucca Beni Culturali, l'incontro internazionale di Promo PA Fondazione dedicato a cultura e innovazione, si terrà il 6 e 7 ottobre al Real Collegio di Lucca, con la direzione di Francesca Velani (lubec.it).

Due giorni intensi di appuntamenti, tutti gratuiti, con partner nazionali e internazionali, che vedranno direttori dei principali musei d'Italia e del mondo, economisti, scrittori, filosofi, artisti, amministratori, dirigenti, operatori ed esperti del settore confrontarsi in quello che, da 18 anni, è l'appuntamento cardine, a livello nazionale, del dibattito tra pubblica amministrazione, impresa e terzo settore, luogo di aggregazione e accumulazione culturale, generatore di azioni per lo sviluppo territoriale a base culturale.

LuBeC è un laboratorio di idee nel quale l'incontro tra pubblico e privato favorisce la nascita di progetti condivisi in campo socio-culturale ed economico e strategie d'intervento concreto, necessarie per far fronte alle sfide sociali ed ecologiche del presente.

La manifestazione metterà l'innovazione - dei processi, dei prodotti, delle tecnologie e della società - al centro delle riflessioni sul presente e sul prossimo futuro, approfondendo il ruolo della cultura come motore della transizione e l'attuazione del PNRR in tutte le misure che interagiscono con la cultura. Saranno presentati e messi a confronto progetti, visioni, strumenti e risultati su temi che vanno dal rapporto tra cultura e metacultura al ruolo dei musei nel futuro, dalla rinnovata alleanza con il design e l'industria alla rigenerazione sociale e culturale dei borghi, dall'accessibilità all'ibridazione dei generi per la crescita delle imprese culturali e creative, fino ai nuovi autori e nuovi pubblici per lo spettacolo dal vivo.

""LuBeC è la vetrina del cambiamento - dichiara Gaetano Scognamiglio, Presidente di Promo PA Fondazione - Fruizioni e valorizzazione dei beni culturali si evolvono velocemente e così anche tutto il mondo che ruota intorno alla cultura. La scorsa settimana, per fare un esempio, la settima edizione di wop art a Lugano ha accolto accanto alle opere su carta opere su NFT, aprendo un dibattito su rapporto fra carta e digitale in un futuro assai vicino. I musei ormai sono aperti al digitale e la fruizione delle opere avviene attraverso percorsi esperienziali con tecnologie immersive. Ai riferimenti tradizionali dei grandi attrattori culturali lentamente si stanno affiancando opere e beni culturali che vengono riscoperti anche grazie alla valorizzazione dei borghi che diventano neo-luoghi dove addirittura andare a vivere e poter lavorare a distanza. Di questo e di altre ""mutazioni"" si parlerà nella diciottesima edizione di LuBeC che ospita nuovamente ISIE, il summit internazionale su quanto c'è di nuovo nel mondo in materia di immersività"".

Per accompagnare il cambiamento, gettare solide basi per il futuro e per il lavoro dei giovani, occorre conoscere a fondo il potenziale del binomio cultura-digitale. Durante la due-giorni torna, dopo il successo della scorsa edizione, ISIE - International Summit of Immersive Experience, dedicato alla pluralità delle esperienze che possono essere vissute a livello intellettuale e sensoriale tra mondi reali e digitali.

Tema della seconda edizione del Summit sarà Musei del futuro, una riflessione con le voci più importanti del panorama italiano e internazionale su come le istituzioni museali adatteranno la propria offerta culturale al linguaggio digitale, sulle possibilità offerte dal metaverso e la nuova produzione creativa che in tale ambiente si sviluppa, su rischi e opportunità di questo nuovo paradigma. Nato in ambito cyberpunk e tornato al centro delle discussioni in tempi recenti dopo gli annunci di Facebook e di altre aziende tech, il metaverso apre a una pluralità di esperienze da vivere a livello emotivo, fisico, intellettuale e sensoriale: in termini di edutainment, le soluzioni per i musei sono pressoché illimitate.

""L'evoluzione è una sintesi fra progresso e tradizione, è spingere in avanti la storia attraverso tecnologia e creatività, veicolare la comunicazione nella logica della diffusione del sapere - afferma Mario Pardini, sindaco di Lucca. La sfida del nostro tempo sta nella valorizzazione e capitalizzazione del nostro immenso patrimonio culturale attraverso mezzi digitali e metodi scientifici, per raggiungere una fruizione più ampia abbattendo le tradizionali barriere analogiche, ma senza abbandonare il valore aggiunto dell'esperienza classica. Tutto questo è LuBeC, l'evento che ci insegna quanto sia importante ripartire dalla cultura, intesa come humus fondamentale e motore di crescita primario della nostra società"".

""La cultura è oggi riconosciuta dai policy makers come driver per lo sviluppo sostenibile e fattore determinate per affrontare le pressioni e i bisogni economici, sociali ed ecologici del nostro tempo, stimolo da un lato all'innovazione e alla competitività, e dall'altro alla partecipazione e alla coesione sociale - aggiunge Francesca Velani. Per mettere a terra questa visione servono politiche e progettualità dedicate allo sviluppo a base culturale, fondate su di una reale collaborazione pubblico-privato, e LuBeC rappresenta il luogo in cui è possibile condividere le idee e le soluzioni per vincere questa sfida. Ciò che saremo in grado realizzare oggi, insieme, sarà il nostro patrimonio dopo il Recovery Plan, e potremo considerarlo davvero un investimento se avremo investito nelle persone e costruito modelli produttivi mettendo in dialogo la cultura e creatività con ambiente, sviluppo locale, salute e coesione sociale, occupazione e benessere"".

GLI HIGHLIGHTS DEL PROGRAMMA

LuBeC dà il via alla sua riflessione con un incontro sul tema Cultura, metacultura e nuove alleanze, aperto da Eugenio Giani, Governatore della Regione Toscana con Angela Acordon, Soprintendente Archeologia, Belle Arti e Paesaggio Lucca e Massa Carrara, e introdotto da Gaetano Scognamiglio.

Cultura e metaverso: scenari e competenze è il focus affidato a Christian Greco, Direttore del Museo Egizio di Torino, che si confronta con il pioniere della Data Science e dei Big Data Dino Pedreschi, direttore del KDD LAB (Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Laboratory), centro di ricerca congiunto fra l'Università di Pisa e l'Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione del CNR; e con l'architetto Alessandra Vittorini, Direttore della Fondazione Scuola dei Beni e delle Attività Culturali, cui è affidato il rinnovamento delle competenze del sistema culturale nazionale.

Il punto sugli investimenti del PNRR per le città sarà fatto dall'economista Gustavo Piga, co-founder di OrEP-Osservatorio sul Recovery Plan; insieme a Rocco De Nicola, Rettore della Scuola IMT Alti Studi di Lucca; Angelantonio Orlando, Responsabile Unità di Missione e attuazione del PNRR del MiC; Francesco Profumo, Presidente di ACRI, e Matteo Ricci, Sindaco di Pesaro, Capitale Italiana della Cultura 2024.

Il terzo focus verterà sulla nuova alleanza tra cultura, design e impresa, un panel multidisciplinare con Katia Da Ros, Vice Presidente di Confindustria per Ambiente, Cultura e Sostenibilità; Onofrio Cutaia, Direttore Generale Creatività Contemporanea del MiC; Gian Maria Tosatti, artista e autore del Padiglione Italiano della Biennale d'Arte di Venezia 2022; Corrado Beldì, Vicepresidente Laterlite S.p.A: un unico spazio di incontro per progettare futuri modi di vivere, inclusivi di arte, cultura, scienza e tecnologia.

Il pomeriggio sarà dedicato agli approfondimenti per la realizzazione dei progetti PNRR. Sul Piano Nazionale Borghi, in collaborazione con MiC e Regione Toscana, un incontro coordinato Gaetano Scognamiglio per approfondire l'attuazione e la misurazione d'impatto dei progetti, dal punto di vista della governance, della sostenibilità e dei partenariati con Angelantonio Orlando, Direttore Generale Unità di Missione attuazione PNRR Ministero della Cultura; Vincenzo Santoro, Responsabile Cultura dell'ANCI; Ottavia Ricci, coordinatrice del Comitato Nazionale Borghi del MiC; Roberta Corbò, Responsabile Patrimoni territoriali, comunità locali e turismo di Confartigianato Imprese e Francesca Velani. Da questo primo confronto nasceranno due tavoli di lavoro, uno per i borghi di linea A, con gli interventi di Antonella Recchia, Presidente della Commissione di Valutazione Borghi Linea A, Luca Parodi, Direttore Cultura Regione Liguria e Coordinatore tecnico Commissione Cultura Conferenza Regioni e P.A, Cristina Ambrosini, Responsabile Settore Patrimonio culturale Regione Emilia Romagna. L'altro per i piccoli comuni della Linea B, che vedrà la presentazione nazionale del bando da 200 milioni di euro dedicato alle Imprese che nei borghi vorranno insediarsi, a confronto con Giampiero Marchesi, Presidente della Commissione Bando Borghi Linea B, Luigi Scaroina, e alcuni sindaci di borghi selezionati dal bando, in rappresentanza delle istanze degli oltre 240 vincitori provenienti da tutto il Paese.

Sulle Imprese Culturali e Creative ancora opportunità in arrivo dal PNRR, e con esse anche l'urgenza di definire le competenze necessarie per sostenere la richiesta di innovazione che si leva sempre più forte dai settori culturali tradizionali, dalle arti performative, dal design sino all'architettura e alla moda. LuBeC sarà quindi occasione per proporre modalità di trasformazione delle competenze anche in vista del bando da 155 milioni di euro in prossima uscita e destinato al sistema delle ICC: ne discuteranno, con il coordinamento di Angelo Argento, Presidente di Cultura Italiae, Onofrio Cutaia, Vittorio Fresa, Service Unit Cultura Crea INVITALIA; Ugo Bacchella, fondatore di Fondazione Fitzcarraldo; Giovanna Barni, Presidente dell'Associazione Cultura Turismo e Comunicazione di Lega Coop; Matteo Bagnasco, responsabile Obiettivo Cultura Fondazione Compagnia di San Paolo; Umberto Croppi, Direttore Federculture e Marco Tortoioli Ricci, Presidente di AIAP (Associazione italiana design della comunicazione visiva).

4;;"VRChatとは、VR空間上で世界中のユーザーとコミュニケーションを楽しめるサービスである。

Facebookが社名を「メタ」に変更したことで、世界で大きく注目されることになった「メタバース」だが、その言葉が注目を浴びる以前から、VRChatはユーザーが活発なサービスだ。2022年現在、世界で最も接続者の多いVR空間として人気を集めており、VRChatをきっかけにVRの世界に魅了されたというユーザーも少なくない。

世界で最も""カオス""なVR空間「VRChat」とはなにか--その魅力から始め方までを解説（2021年7月15日掲載）

筆者自身も、VRChat上で、学校コミュニティ「私立VRC学園」を立ち上げたりしていたなか、プロの画家である植村友哉さん【ウェブサイト】【Instagram】から「VR・メタバースを使った美術館、個展を開きたい」という相談を受け、VRChat上で展示会を公開している。植村友哉さんの作品やその他のアーティストの作品を複数点展示し、いまでは美術や作品についてプロの解説を聞くことのできる人気のイベントとなった。

デジタルアートを描くユーザーが、自身の作品をメタバース上に展示することは昨今見受けられるようになったが、プロとして活動している画家が、油絵やアクリル絵の具を使った自分の作品をメタバース上に展示することは珍しい。そこで今回は、メタバースに活動の幅を広げている画家の植村友哉さんにお話を伺った。

小学校は柔道、中学校～大学はレスリング部に所属しスポーツに没頭する傍ら、小学生の頃から自由帳に模写を始め、独学で絵を描くようになった植村友哉さん。画家になる以前は植村さんは、大学卒業後は食品メーカーに就職し、営業をしていた。人と話すことは得意だったため、営業職を楽しんではいたものの、2016年に縁あって訪れたパラオ共和国の地で、日本では見られないような綺麗な景色に言葉を失う。「自分もこのパラオの景色のように自分らしくいられたら楽しいだろう」と感動したことが画家を志すきっかけとなった。この時にパラオ現地でスケッチし、日本に持ち帰って油絵に直した作品は、植村さんの画家としてのキャリア初の受賞作となった。

画家として活動していくなか、世間はコロナ禍になり、リアルでの個展の開催やパラオとの文化交流が困難になった。そのなかで「どうにか低接触型での展示会の開催やパラオとの美術を通じた文化交流ができないか」と思い、メタバース上で美術展を行いたいと考えたという。

周囲に相談していくもなかなかテクノロジーに詳しい人に出会えず苦労したが、筆者である齊藤大将と知り合い、VR美術館「WESON MUSEUM」がスタートする。

VR美術館で目指しているところとしては、絵を美術文化として、各国の交流として美術を活用できるのではないかということ。そして、 各国の作品をいつでもどこでも見れるというボーダレスな展示空間、と植村さんは答える。

メタバースを使って作品を展示することは、メディアとしての機能が大きい。しかし植村さんは、ただ単に自分や周囲の作品をメタバース上に展示するのではなく、美術文化としての側面を意識している。メタバースの技術の側面をうまく活用すると、それは美術文化発展に繋がる可能性もある。

前述したように、植村さんはパラオ共和国との親睦が深いアーティストであり、パラオを表現した作品も数多く制作している。アナログの作品を画像データなどに変換し、メタバース上に展示すると、作品の見え方やテクスチャ、想いや制作の背景などは伝わりにくくなる。美術文化や美術史の観点からすると、素直に喜べることではないだろう。

しかし、メタバースを使うことでの役割は別のところにある、と植村さんは考えている。

毎週世界中からの訪問者と自身のVR美術館での交流を通し、場所や時間的な縛りが少ないVR美術館だからこそ、リアルで開催する個展よりもコミュニケーションが取りやすく、多種多様な人に美術というものを知ってもらう機会を生むという考え方だ。

VR美術館「WESON MUSEUM」には、パラオ人アーティストの作品も数点展示してある。日本にいては触れることがない作品であり、またパラオにいる方も日本に来ないと観ることができない作品もある。そういった物理的制約を無視して、新しい領域や文化に触れることをVRやメタバースは可能にしている。

文化は積み上げていくもの。メタバースを使うことによって新しい感動、それをテーマにして新たな作品が生まれるかもしれない。

パラオとの国際交流で進めた植村さんと、それを支える筆者齊藤のVR美術館の活動。実際の作品との見え方を比較すると色なども鮮やかさは下がってしまうが、一番の利点は「会話ができること」と植村さんは答える。観に来たあらゆる人とアーティストが双方向のやりとりができるという点は、これまでにあまり見られない展示会のスタイルである。

実際、リアルで個展を開催しても、その訪問者の多くが自分のファンや同じ業界の人、あるいは所属する芸術コミュニティの人間である。一方で、VR美術館に訪れるユーザーのほとんどは、美術に全く関わってもなければ、美術館にもほとんど行かないというような人々だ。毎週のように参加していただいているユーザーさんにも「全く美術に興味がなかった。でも、VRで美術への敷居がだいぶ下がり、気軽に来れるから行ってみようという気持ちになる」と話していた。

美術館や展示会に実際に足を運ぶとなると、たどり着くまでに障壁が多い。週末の予定を確認し、時間を確認し、ネットでチケットを購入し、電車で現地に向かい、順番に作品を観る。休憩などを挟めば半日から1日かかってしまう。だがVRであれば、ネット環境があれば自宅からいつでも作品を観ることができる。美術がわからないって人にも届きやすいこのメタバースという切り口が、美術に関わる人の裾野を広げることに役立つ。

VR美術館「WESON MUSEUM」には4つあるワールドがあり、それぞれ違ったテーマで構成されている。空に浮いた美術館に入り芸術体験ができる「天空美術館」や森林にいそうな鳥などを題材にした「森林美術館」、南国の植物などを題材に大きな植物の葉っぱをのぼりながら鑑賞し、落ちると最初からというゲーム性も取り入れた「雨降る美術館」などが体験できる。そして、パラオの美しい景色の中に美術館をつくった「パラオ美術館」。

作品の見え方や色合いは、直接作品を観ることと比べると、どうしても質が下がってしまうが、一方で、展示空間自体を作品に合わせて制作することで、より見に来る人を楽しませやすくなる。近年では、美術館へ足を運ぶ若者の数が減少傾向にある中、デジタルアートなどの展示会は人気傾向になる。その事実を踏まえると、VR美術館を使った作品の展示は、多くの人々にとって敷居の高そうな美術との距離を縮める役割を担えるかもしれない。

VRで美術の展示をすると良いことばかりに見えるが「全体的には批判的な意見が多い」と植村さんは答える。もちろん新しいことを始めると批判や意見はつきものである。

メタバースを美術展示に活用することは、現状あくまでメディアとしての効能は感じるが、美術的な技術が広がるわけではない。

デジタル絵画は、アナログ絵画と違って色彩などを数値化することができる。つまりデジタル絵画は再現性が高い。一方で、アナログ絵画は異文化ならでは違いや、湿気や時間経過などが反映されるため、再現性が低い。また、描く人の筋力差によるタッチの違いをはじめとして細かく複雑に絡み合った要素が作品に影響するのである。

美術的制限もメタバースではより強く働く。例えば、アクリル画と油絵の違いもメタバースでは見てる人からはわかりにくい。美術の表現が与えることが、観る人に100%伝わってるかは微妙なところである。そのため、鑑賞者の意識に作家の想いや気遣いが届くかは作家としては自信があまりないと植村さんは言う。

植村さんは自分の作品発表としてメタバースを活用しているというよりは、作品を使って誰かと繋がりたいという想いでメタバースを活用している。

自分の表現方法が絵であり、それを使って人と繋がる場としてのメタバース。表現したい概念がまず作品にあり、作品を誰かに納得してもらいたいという気持ちは少ない。色と形を使って表現しようした結果、その絵になっただけである。

そのような想いのもとに生まれた作品は、VRゴーグルを通して鑑賞された場合、それでは伝わない細かな気遣いや想い、感情や背景にあるストーリーがたくさんある。作品を作った当初の想いと、メタバースでの見せ方に矛盾が生じる。この点は、絵をただ上手く描けば良いというだけの人にはわかりずらい部分かもしれない。

そのため、メタバースを使うことで美術の文化や技術発展には繋がらないだろうという意見を否定することもできないし、メタバースを活用して美術の裾野広げる活動を納得してもらうべきかもわからないと植村さんは付け加える。

「以前、桜の絵を木の額にしれて、その木の額に穴を開けて桜の香料をいれたことがあったんです。桜の絵から桜の匂いがしたら面白いと思いまして。エンターテイメント的なものですね。ですが、だいぶ批判されました」

絵は布などに絵の具がのったもの。その中で小細工をせず、どうやって自分の感情を表現するかということが求められる。つまり、VR美術館は作品表現の域にはまだ達しておらず、現状は植村さんが考えるように、作品を通じて人と繋がる場、メディアとしての空間が最適なのかもしれない。

一方で、近年では多くのアーティストがSNSに自分の作品を載せ、作品を売ったり、作品発表をすることが当たり前になった。その現状を切り取ると、数年後、VR美術館がアーティストにとって当たり前になる可能性もある。

そもそもデジタル上でアナログ作品を扱うというのが難しい。しかし、人と繋がる場やメディアとしてのメタバースの使い方は、芸術に関わる人たちにとっても無視できないものになるのかもしれない。";{'uri': 'cnet.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNET'}
5;;"El metaverso promete nuevas experiencias a los usuarios que tengan acceso a ella.

Ante la constante evolución tecnológica, las marcas se adaptan a los nuevos modelos de negocios. Ciertas empresas se están apresurando a registrar sus marcas en el metaverso, aunque todavía no sea una realidad. Este nuevo mundo virtual promete nuevas experiencias a los usuarios que tengan acceso a ella.

El metaverso es una red de intercomunicación virtual donde los usuarios podrán acceder a diversos eventos: eventos deportivos, conciertos, museos, participar en videojuego, comprar productos y bienes virtuales o reales. Cuando Mark Zuckerberg explicó este espacio virtual, indicó que los usuarios tendrán la posibilidad de interactuar y conectarse con otros para jugar, trabajar, comprar y explorando desde cualquier parte del mundo real. Según cifras oficiales, el dueño de Facebook invirtió 18 millones 500 mil de dólares a su división realidad virtual y a la realidad aumentada.

Se estima que para el 2025, el metaverso tenga un valor en la industria de 800 millones de dólares. Por otro lado, los usuarios que tienen acceso a la realidad aumentada móvil es de 1 mil 730.

Ante este nuevo desarrollo, las empresas han comenzado a voltear a ver al metaverso con la principal intención de proteger sus marcas dentro de ese nuevo mundo virtual. Para registrar una marca en el metaverso, se necesita de un estrategia legal adecuada, además de licencias de uso, términos y condiciones de parte de las empresas para evitar que se apropien de sus marcas.

Por esta razón se recomienda registrar las marcas en la categoría de productos y servicios virtuales para que tengan una completa protección. Muchas empresas de ropa, cosméticos y calzado, entre otras; han optado por solicitar el registro en la Unión Europea y Estados Unidos. El registro de marcas en metaverso también permitirá a los usuarios hacer uso de las mismas dentro del mundo virtual, como sucede con algunas marcas de lujo como Gucci y Louis Vuitton ya han lanzado skins para los avatares digitales.

Las acciones que las empresas están haciendo para adaptarse al nuevo entorno digital tienen que ver con la presentación de solicitudes para registrar las marcas por el uso de sus productos virtuales. El registro se hace con relación a la división de la clasificación internacional de productos conocida como 'Clasificación de Nisa', algunas de las empresas que han registrado sus marcas por el uso de sus productos virtuales descargables son programas informáticos de clase 9, servicios comerciales con productos virtuales de clase 35, servicios de entretenimiento de clase 35, NFT y productos virtuales que no se descargan en línea de clase 42 y servicios financieros, incluidos tokens digitales de clase 36.

Entre las marcas que ya se adentraron al metaverso se encuentra McDonald's, Nike, L'Oreal, Adidas, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Dior, Balenciaga, Converse, Sony, Coca-Cola, Ferrari, Levi Strauss, New Balance Athletics, Versache, Heineken, Unilever, L'Oreal, Sotheby's y Samsung, sólo por mencionar algunas.

Desafortunadamente la Ley Federal de Protección a la Propiedad Industrial aún no contempla los casos de uso en el metaverso, sin embargo, sí se puede aplicar en la parte de infracciones cuando el titular ha registrado su marca en los productos o servicios que ampare el registro. Las infracciones que se pueden aplicar son:

En México aún no hay casos denunciados en el Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial (IMPI), como ha sucedido con otros casos por el uso de nombre de dominio, el uso de marcas en motores de búsqueda y redes sociales.

Por otro lado, la Ley Federal de Derechos de Autor también podría abarcar para las marcas que están entrando en el metaverso, ya que establece que el autor o titular de una obra tiene el derecho de autorizar o prohibir el uso de la misma en cualquier medio. Al difundir una marca en el metaverso, si alguien más desea hacer uso de la misma, necesitaría la completa autorización de la empresa; pero si se comparte o se hace uso de la misma sin autorización, ya se estaría cometiendo un delito y la sanción podría ser una indemnización por daños a la empresa dueña de la marca.

Si bien el metaverso resulta algo atractivo por la capacidad de interactuar con otros individuos en un mundo virtual, se debe tener en cuenta la importancia de proteger y hacer valer los derechos de las marcas para que las empresas comercialicen, promuevan y hagan publicad de sus productos y servicios de forma segura.

調査したメタバースのユーザー、見込みユーザー、さらには使用が未定のユーザーのほとんどが、メタバースが「出会いやつながり、ネットワークといった新しいビジネスチャンスの機会につながる」と認識している。

KPMG Enterprise Innovationの米国の責任者、クリフ・ジャスティス氏は9月8日のプレスリリースで、「米国の成人はフィジタル（フィジカルとデジタルを掛け合わせた造語）世界でリアルライフ体験を作り出すことに適応している」と述べた（注2）。また、KPMGの幹部はメタバースの利用が人々の生活を追随して実現していることを示し、「銀行や遠隔医療、学習や仕事に至るまで、日常生活の多くがバーチャルへと移行している」と指摘する。

また、メタバースのユーザー、見込みユーザー、さらには使用が未定のユーザーのほとんどが、「遠隔健康診断の予約」や「博物館や史跡のバーチャルツアー」「ショッピング」にメタバースを利用したいと考えていることが分かった。これらの選択肢のすぐ後にランクインしたのは、「ストリーミングコンサート」や「デジタルファッションショー」と並んで、「バーチャル企業会議」（65％）と「L&D」（65％）であった。

2022年初め、アメリカ合衆国の経営学誌であるHarvard Business Reviewは、NextMeet、PixelMax、Microsoft（HoloLensと呼ばれるテクノロジーを使用）、Metaverse Learningなど、Meta以外に職場に革命を起こしている、アバターベースのバーチャルリアリティープラットフォームを年代別に紹介した。

このレビューは、VR教育の可能性とともに、オフィスで同僚に「ばったり」出会うような（仮想）職場でのセレンディピティな出会い、神秘的なウェルビーイング空間、フードデリバリーの統合、ライブステータスの追跡など、HR以外の側面も強調している。

メタバース分野で最も有名な、マーク・ザッカーバーグ氏のアバターユニバース「Meta」に懐疑的な社会評論家もいることから、メタバースと仕事の未来に関するこの新しい環境は興味深いものになっている（注3）。ゲーマーやCNNは、Metaのグラフィックの質の低さや技術的な限界を頻繁に報じている（注4、5）。The New York Times紙は、Metaのリブランド後の誇大広告が口先だけだとザッカーバーグ氏を継続的に非難している（注6）。

人事部門について言うと、最高人事責任者は""職場文化の有害な側面""がどのようにデジタルに変換されるかを考慮する必要がある（注7、8）。例えば、メタバースにおけるセクシャルハラスメントは依然として大きな問題だ。この問題は、KPMGの調査対象者の約3分の1も同じように懸念している。

コストについては、「Meta Quest 2ゴーグル」は400ドルの投資だが、人事担当者は、このL&Dテクノロジーに付随する学習曲線にも注目すべきだ（注9）。キャリアの専門家はHR Diveに、技術的適性の世代間格差は「リバースメンタリング（逆指導）」で解決できると語っている（注10）。

このL&Dモデルでは、若い従業員が年上の従業員を、通常はテクノロジーの使い方や進歩的な文化的問題について教育する権限を与え、年齢差別を緩和できるという。

あらゆるイノベーションやビジネスと同様に、人事担当者はメタバースが自分たちの組織に適しているかどうか、長所と短所を比較検討する必要がある。";{'uri': 'kn.itmedia.co.jp', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'キーマンズネット'}

UAE hopes the metaverse can add $4 billion to annual GDP and 40,000 jobs by 2030. (Representational)

Dubai:

The United Arab Emirates, which already boasts the world's tallest skyscraper and has launched a bold Mars mission, now hopes to become a pioneer in the depths of the metaverse.

In a project launched at Dubai's gleaming Museum of the Future, it announced that the UAE's economy ministry was setting up shop inside the immersive virtual world that is now taking shape.

Those who don their virtual reality goggles or use other means to venture within will find a ministry open for business with companies and even ready to sign bilateral agreements with foreign governments, officials said.

The metaverse is an online world where users will eventually be able to game, work, and study, its proponents say -- although it is still in a ""test"" phase, the UAE's economy minister conceded.

Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri was speaking at the inaugural Dubai Metaverse Assembly, held at the museum whose innovative ring shape decorated with Arabic calligraphy flanks the city's main thoroughfare.

Representatives of tech giants mingled with entrepreneurs and developers exploring the potential of the metaverse, a network of digital spaces intended as an extension of the physical world.

""In the last couple of years we've seen investments, we've seen companies move in, and with the changes of the (visa) regime... we see talent coming in,"" Al Marri told AFP in an interview.

""We trained our employees to really immerse themselves in the metaverse, use the metaverse and engage with the Generation Z that is going to come,"" he added.

The UAE, which has a history of bold projects including the 830-metre (2,723-foot) Burj Khalifa, hopes the metaverse can add $4 billion to annual GDP and 40,000 jobs to its workforce by 2030.

In its bid to become one of the world's top-10 metaverse economies, Dubai wants to attract 1,000 companies specialising in blockchain and related technologies, helped by eased visa rules for freelancers, entrepreneurs, and creatives.

As the coronavirus pandemic pushed more people into the online world, ""Covid really accelerated"" the trend, Al Marri added.

""We thought the metaverse is a phase technology"" that might take 10 to 20 years to emerge,"" he said. ""Covid-19 really immersed us so fast and expedited the use of the metaverse.""

Virtual Mars trips

Unlike the UAE's oil-rich capital, Abu Dhabi, crude represents just five percent of Dubai's economy which has pivoted towards business, tourism, real estate, and new technologies.

The UAE has already introduced a law governing virtual assets and a regulatory body for cryptocurrencies while welcoming major crypto exchange platforms.

One of the UAE's early private-sector metaverse projects is called 2117, named after the dream of Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid to colonise Mars a century from now.

Metaverse users can now buy tickets to join a virtual shuttle carrying settlers to the red planet.

""A lot of us won't live long enough to see this mission with our own eyes,"" said Amin Al Zarouni, founder of the Bedu start-up behind the virtual Mars trip.

""We'll try to replicate this experience in the metaverse.""

Until now, the use of the metaverse is niche and even its architects say widespread adoption is years away. How it will develop is unknown.

According to Meta, which owns Facebook and other social media titans, Analysis Group research has shown that the metaverse could add $360 billion to GDP in the Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey in 10 years if it follows the growth pattern of mobile technology.

""We also know that when policy supports innovation, it accelerates the adoption of new technologies,"" the company said when asked about Dubai's prospects of becoming a metaverse hub.

Si usted visita este fin de semana la Gran Feria Inmobiliaria de Vanguardia en Neomundo podrá vivir una experiencia de realidad virtual a través del Sistema Informativo con mayor reconocimiento en Santander.

Y es que durante este evento, usted podrá acercarse al stand de vanguardia y allí, los desarrolladores del proyecto en el Metaverso le facilitaran unas gafas especiales con las que podrá hacer un recorrido en el tiempo. En este espacio se podrán ver los hechos de mayor relevancia noticiosa de Santander, Colombia y el Mundo, inmortalizados en el periódico, a través de 103 años de historia.

Allí, en un museo virtual de cinco niveles está desde la primera Editorial de Vanguardia, pasando por la llegada del hombre a la luna, la muerte de Pablo Escobar y hasta el confinamiento que se vivió durante la pandemia del COVID-19.

De acuerdo con el subdirector de Innovación de Vanguardia, Alejandro Guzmán, Vanguardia, dentro de su línea de Laboratorio de Innovación está dando a conocer nuevas maneras de contar, nuevas narrativas, nuevos formatos y nuevos modelos de comunicación. ""Aquí entra toda la línea del Metaverso que, es donde este instante, se están generando diferentes contenidos y modelos de negocio"", afirmó.

Guzmán dijo que en compañía del Tecnoparque del Sena Bucaramanga y de la empresa santandereana Crypto Graphics World se desarrolló este escenario virtual en el que ""se inmortalizaron las portadas de Vanguardia en el Metaverso, un escenario disruptivo y a donde se están dirigiendo todas las iniciativas en materia de tecnología"".

Para la selección de las 103 portadas, según el jefe de redacción de Vanguardia, Juan Carlos Chío, ""se buscó que estuvieran reflejadas todas las épocas y cambios que ha tenido el medio en los más de cien años de historia. De igual forma, hay unas salas temáticas con una selección especial de portadas. Una de estas, por ejemplo, es la sala del Cartel de Medellín, donde se puede ver cómo fue el cubrimiento de la época de violencia de finales de los años 80 y principios de 90. Allí el usuario encontrará, entre otros, la portada del día posterior a la bomba contra Vanguardia en 1989, así como otros atentados terroristas como los ataques contra la sede del DAS y El Espectador y el asesinato de Luis Carlos Galán, Carlos Pizarro y Bernardo Jaramillo"".

Uno de los desarrolladores de esta iniciativa fue Brayan Aparicio de Crypto Graphics World, quien se encargó del modelado de módulos y escenarios quien explicó que para darle vida a este proyecto ""tuvimos que trabajar en la adecuación de un museo, darle iluminación, ajustar cuadros para poner las portadas y darle un contexto futurista al escenario pese a que algunas de estas primeras páginas tenían muchos años de antigüedad. Las recuperamos y las pusimos en un marco especial para hacerlas visualmente más agradables"".

El desarrollador destacó el hecho de que ""es una iniciativa con proyección. Muchas empresas están incursionando en ello y participar de la incursión de Vanguardia al Metaverso, del homenaje a estos 103 años de historia nos llena de orgullo y nos lleva a mejorar y seguir en este trabajo por llevar las noticias ' a otro nivel'..."".

Asimismo, el dinamizador del Tecnoparque Nodo Bucaramanga, Cristian Vera, afirmó que este es un gran paso al futuro por parte del medio de comunicación porque ""se podrán realizar entrevistas en puntos diferentes del mundo con avatars que interactúan en tiempo real sin necesidad de estar en un mismo espacio físico"".

El apoyo por parte del Tecnoparque fue vital para permitir que luego de cerca de siete meses de trabajo se tenga listo este escenario para que este fin de semana pueda ser visitado por los asistentes a la Feria.

10;;"Alla grande fiera della tecnologia, che si terrà a Roma dal 7 al 9 ottobre

Da quando è stato annunciato da Mark Zuckerberg lo scorso novembre, il mondo virtuale e totalmente immersivo che va sotto il nome di metaverso ha generato aspettative (e investimenti) enormi. Meta ha promesso una rivoluzione totale del nostro modo di vivere internet e il concetto è poco a poco penetrato sia nell'immaginario collettivo che in quello imprenditoriale, tanto che già oggi in Inghilterra due aziende su tre credono fermamente che il metaverso sarà un catalizzatore inarrestabile verso la transizione digitale. Non stupisce quindi che tra le novità più attese alla prossima edizione della Maker Faire Rome, la grande fiera dell'innovazione promossa e organizzata dalla Camera di Commercio di Roma dal 7 al 9 ottobre nell'area del Gazometro Ostiense, ci sarà proprio il metaverso, in tutte le sue declinazioni e potenzialità creative.

Maker Faire 2022, Tagliavanti: ""L'innovazione per le sfide epocali"". All'Ostiense il polo ""delle novità""

PARCO A TEMA

A partire da quel ""Metaverse Movie Festival"" che porterà per la prima volta alla fiera un catalogo di film girati in realtà virtuale, dove a farla da padrone sarà l'interazione tra lo spettatore e l'opera, con un palinsesto che spazia dai documentari all'intrattenimento, dal gaming alla videodanza, fino a interi spettacoli teatrali appositamente pensati per essere riprodotti in realtà virtuale. L'avevamo già visto nella ""Venice Immersive"" del festival di Venezia, quando l'isola del Lazzaretto Vecchio ha cambiato faccia trasformandosi in un vero e proprio parco a tema VR che ha coinvolto i visitatori in un'esperienza cinematografica tutta nuova fatta di portali olografici e sensori per il tracciamento capaci di catapultarli dritti all'interno del film.

IN SALA

Stesso approccio anche per il Metaverse Movie Festival, dove gli spettatori potranno sperimentare diversi tipi di tecnologie con un diverso grado di interazione, dal filmato a 360° non interattivo a videogame totalmente immersivi, dal documentario di inchiesta per appassionati di giornalismo al cortometraggio animato per i più piccoli. Un bel passo avanti rispetto a Netflix Party, timido accenno di metaverso dove già adesso si possono vedere film online con gli amici e scambiarsi commenti in chat in tempo reale. Ma, come in tutte le rivoluzioni, anche qui si va per gradi. Il passo successivo è quello intrapreso da Shemaroo Entertainment, content creator con base in India che all'interno del metaverso Decentraland ha ricostruito da zero una sala cinematografica completamente tridimensionale (con tanto di bibite e pop-corn virtuali) dove i nostri avatar possano sedersi comodamente e ammirare la rassegna (composta principalmente da proiezioni bollywoodiane) proiettata in 2d sullo schermo della sala. Intanto l'industria cinematografica si sta muovendo pian piano verso lo step finale, cioè un futuro dove a farla da padrone saranno la coesione e interazione totale tra mondo fisico e realtà virtuale/aumentata. Per ora parliamo principalmente di produttori indipendenti, ma già alcuni big, tra cui Disney e HBO, stanno muovendo i primi passi verso il mondo phygital.

LA STANZA

L'idea è quella di stravolgere per sempre il modo in cui fruiamo di media, tv e film, disegnando un universo cinematografico dove lo spettatore - che in questa concezione è anche attore e regista - possa contemporaneamente vivere e creare il film. Un concetto portato alla sua massima espressione nella Fabroom presente alla Maker Faire, una stanza immersiva che fonderà virtuale e reale avvolgendo lo spettatore con immagini proiettate dalle pareti intorno. Con queste immagini, grazie ai sensori presenti all'interno della stanza, potremo interagire attraverso i movimenti della mano o semplicemente parlando. Tanti anche gli stand a tema metaverso presenti alla fiera. ""Rappresentare lo spazio virtuale"" è un progetto del dipartimento di architettura di Roma Tre che esplora l'impatto della VR sul mondo architettonico, indagando sul modo in cui il metaverso, e più in generale la VR, potranno cambiare la nostra percezione degli spazi fisici. Interamente dedicato all'orientamento scolastico è invece ""OrientaVerso"" della Fondazione ITS per l'ICT Piemonte, una vetrina virtuale pensata per gli studenti che lasciano la scuola superiore e che adesso avranno a disposizione un intero metaverso dove essere guidati nella scelta del percorso più appropriato, esplorando contenuti e partecipando a eventi dedicati. Molto interessanti anche ""Oltre il museo"" dell'università di Siena, un progetto che sperimenta nuovi modelli di servizi e tecnologie innovative (alcune delle quali improntate sul metaverso) per rendere il patrimonio culturale accessibile anche alle persone anziane con disabilità, e ""Spark@Mita"", che porta il metaverso nel mondo reale proiettando su una superficie fisica i contenuti in 3d.";{'uri': 'ilmessaggero.it', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Il Messaggero'}
11;;"Chris Michaels is director of digital, communications and technology at the National Gallery, London. Here he discusses sustainability, NFTs and why technology will be crucial for museums and the climate crisis.

Michaels is also a visiting senior research fellow at King's College, London. At the National Gallery, his directorate has responsibilities for digital services, membership and ticketing, creative, IT and marketing, press and public affairs.

Before he joined the National Gallery, he was head of digital & publishing at the British Museum, where he founded the museum's digital department and created its digital strategy. In addition, he acts as an advisor to the Humboldt Forum in Berlin and has acted as an advisor to museums in Qatar and Singapore. Before entering the world of Museums, he was CEO of educational start-up Mindshapes. He has a PhD from the University of Bristol.

Technology can help us find solutions to the climate crisis. It can help us, as museums, to find ways to communicate with the world, and new ways to solve our own challenges. This is a journey for us all, in the years ahead

Michaels spoke at greenloop 2022 about the rewards and risks of the new technologies for museums and art galleries, specifically the relationship between sustainability and technology.

""The way I'm going to frame this is about the way that both digital and the climate crisis are coming together to help us think about what museums can be in the years ahead,"" he explains. ""Museums are adapting to the climate crisis. We're at the beginning of a long journey. Alongside that adaptation, we're also in a continuing adaptation to a digitising world. The way I want to explore this is in terms of the way these two things are happening together.""

As those things happen together, he says, it is creating new opportunities and new risks.

""What I really want to do is describe the environment in which museums like the National Gallery must approach this new world,"" he says.

""The National Gallery is the best place in the world to see the best paintings in the world. We've been connecting people with paintings since 1824. The first piece I want to talk about is about museums and sustainability, and how we are adapting to the challenges of the climate crisis.""

Here, he clarifies, he is speaking predominantly of the national museums, those large-scale institutions that have a very particular role:

""We are really best described as hybrid organisations, positioned at this very specific point between the government, the private sector, and the public. We are charities and we're businesses, and we have to serve those different needs in different ways.""

The way these museums work as institutions is at multiple levels:

""We work very locally outside our front door on Trafalgar Square. We work at a national level, at an international level. What this combination of roles does is give us a very particular and unique perspective. It also gives us some special responsibilities around what sustainability might mean. Critically, alongside all those things, we have very multilevel relationships with audiences.""

When someone comes to the National Gallery, he explains, they are wearing different identities:

""You come as a citizen of the United Kingdom, or of the country that you come from, to join us. You come as a visitor, as part of a visitor experience, and you come as a customer, sometimes a paying one, to our exhibitions, to go to our shops, our food and beverage outlets. But you also come as our owners. You own the museum on behalf of the country, and we own that. We all own that together.""

Accordingly:

""Our responsibility, really, is to work with audiences, with government, with the private sector and beyond, both on sustainability and on the uses of technology. When it comes to the climate crisis we are, at the National Gallery and at other museums, in a very critical moment of trying to work out what it really means to become sustainable for the long term.""

It is not, he points out, an obvious or an easy journey for those who sit in 200-year-old buildings which leak air, and around which there are very specific environmental and conservation constraints:

""We have hard journeys to go on to work out what sustainability really means for us, and how we can become as sustainable as we possibly can.

""If you look across the wider sector, there is an amazing body of work being carried out, both collectively and individually, to put policy and practice into place. A body of thought is emerging, driven by a way of thinking about some of these questions, that is taking sustainability as a concept, and as practice, and moving it ever closer to the strategic centre of what we do.""

""We are, I think, in a moment of positive momentum about how the museum sector is adapting to the challenges of the climate crisis.""

However, he adds:

""The question is, as for all of us around questions of sustainability, are we going fast enough? Is what we are doing going to have sufficient impact, and can we lead, or do we follow here? Those are difficult, complex questions. Sometimes, quite honestly, I don't think I know the answer.""

But there is, he maintains, a perceptible act of trying that is emerging:

""That trying really has to be the core of everything we do in the months and years ahead.""

Digital change is happening separately, but in parallel to the cultural sector's response to the climate crisis.

""We are really seeing a strong digital transformation of museums. It's really about the culmination of a decade of progressive digital change, building on 25 years of effort that means we are starting to see the digitisation of museums move very strongly to the centre of what they are.""

Michaels did a piece of work at the British Museum in 2015 digitising the whole of the British Museum as a physical space, and putting it on Google Street View. He comments:

""It was that kind of mad project that is, if you like, a sign of change happening. Over the last ten years, a lot of progressive digital change has happened through museums. You can look across the National Gallery, the V&A, the Tate, Liverpool Museums and beyond, and see maturing digital organisations able to embrace both the risks and the opportunities of a digital world.""

Before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, change was accelerating;

""That was often felt as digital projects came into the museums themselves,"" he says. ""At the National Gallery, we ran a fantastic immersive exhibition called Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece. This looked at how digitisation and digital technologies could express and help us think about one of Leonardo's works in different ways.

""There were phenomenal, immersive exhibitions at museums around the world. We started to see how digitisation, the storytelling, the process, the practice that it represents, was coming into the heart of museum life.""

Then COVID hit:

""In a way, everything has gone to another level since then. What I think has really happened in the last two years is that COVID has changed our audiences.""

There has been a step-change as audiences have adopted digital methods, partly as a result of the constraints of COVID. In terms of pre-booking, there has been an interesting shift from audiences accepting the necessity to pre-book as part of the COVID protocol, to actively preferring to pre-book in the post-COVID landscape.

""People now want pre-booking as part of their experience of museums,"" Michaels says. ""COVID has changed our audiences. And what has happened as a result of this period of progressive, accelerated change, is that now digital change is moving very fast in multiple directions at the same time.

""We launched a digital education business in the last couple of years. There has been a phenomenal demand - ten times what we ever saw when we could only offer them in lecture theatres. A virtual reality show that we've been staging at the gallery for the last month and a half has completely sold out.""

""We are seeing a huge audience takeup in our TikTok account, which we launched last year. These things are happening very fast in real time. We're seeing progressive digitisation that has been slowly growing over the last 15 years, massively accelerating in many directions.

""And, of course, new things are coming, [in the shape of] the metaverse, in all its ridiculousness and hopeful potential. A whole next generation of technologies is coming to maturity now. Whether that's virtual reality, augmented reality, virtual worlds, or online blockchain; all this stuff that has been brewing, in some cases for decades. There is suddenly a whole world of opportunity for museums in terms of embracing new kinds of digitisation.""

Everything that we are currently seeing concerning digitisation, he contends, brings together complex issues that will increasingly need addressing:

""I want to touch on the relationship between data growth and carbon growth,"" says Michaels. ""This is the big 'but' in this dialogue. Because whilst progressive digital change has been hugely important, it comes with a cost. Digital change risks becoming a key contributor to carbon emissions. ICT is not one of the major drivers of carbon emissions. It represents somewhere between under 1% to 1.5%.""

Whilst progressive digital change has been hugely important, it comes with a cost. Digital change risks becoming a key contributor to carbon emissions.

""Of course, that is significant. Let's not suggest that it isn't. But, unlike transport, manufacturing, and agriculture, digital technology has not been a significant driver to this point of what has made climate change a reality for us all. But as we now go through this intense growth in digitisation, not just in museums, but in the wider world around us, there is a risk that digital change now becomes a significant driver of carbon change.""

Over the next few years, as carbon begins to level out in other sectors, the digital share of emissions being driven by different sources may reach around 7% to 8%:

""That starts to become a big problem,"" Michaels comments. ""In simple terms, the more we depend on digital, the more data we create. The more data we create, the more carbon we burn. That is the hard part at the heart of this, because that data matters.

""Data is all that the Internet, that digital, is. So, without data, there is no TikTok, no CRM, no virtual reality. There are no websites. In a very simple, trade-off way, without that data, what a museum can be in the 21st century significantly diminishes.""

As digitisation grows, carbon grows; the damage from that carbon also grows alongside it.

Michaels says:

""The trade-off against that is what museums could be because digitisation might have to decrease, as a result. These are hard decisions. New technology has unquestionably begun to bring that data/carbon trade-off into focus in a way that no previous generation of technology seems to have done.""

There has never been as much scrutiny around the amount of carbon generated by digital activity as there has been over the last year, in terms of what blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and, very specifically, NFTs mean from a carbon emissions point of view. The Whitworth created a ""green"" ""Robin Hood"" NFT on proof-of-stake blockchain Tezos, as part of the Economics the Blockbuster research project and exhibition.

""The idea of NFTs, to me, goes hand in hand with the environmental question that sits alongside it. My old employer and our sister institution, the British Museum, has seen this and has effectively stepped into the fire. Its project has received criticism for its carbon costs. To me, those carbon costs, any carbon costs around things like NFTs, are a small part of the problem.""

However:

""As the growth of that avalanche of digital data continues to increase in the next couple of years, the risks of digital, and the relationship between museum digital and the climate crisis, is very plain to us. Suddenly, the cultural sector finds itself in the middle of this argument in a place it hasn't been before.""

This is something, he believes, that will keep on sharpening in focus as we embrace next-generation technologies.

""There are things that people are starting to realise about the emerging space of technology that will all come closer to the centre of our lives in the next ten years.""

This could mean exploring the amount of carbon emissions produced by the process of training an AI model, or the computational power - and therefore carbon use - of the Metaverse, which it is estimated could require a huge step change in resources.

""And then there is the environmental footprint of the apps,"" he adds. ""We are now, of course, all using Zoom every day. We are emitting a huge amount of carbon as a result of this incredible volume of usage.""

""Netflix, of course, is sitting at the top of that. Every time now we see a next-generation technology opportunity for us, we're also going to get a much deeper understanding of the risk and ambiguity of what that means from a carbon point of view. We can't step away from this now. It's in the middle of what we mean about digital change. And it will help us shape and reshape what it will mean in the years ahead.""

What is there to be done?

""These are tough times, with tough thinking and tough decisions to be made,"" Michaels says:

""But I am positive because I can see it happening in the National Gallery; I see it happening elsewhere, that we can and will change behaviours. There are practical things that we can do, from the electricity suppliers we choose to the policies we make that will help us respond as best as we can to the climate crisis, in practical operational terms.""

The real opportunity, however, he says, goes back to the point he made about understanding the unique position of such institutions at the intersection between society, state and market

Art finds new relevance in this time of crisis

""It concerns thinking about how we, as storytelling institutions, can start to think about the future and make sure that the stories we tell live in that future the right way. To me, very simply, art finds new relevance in this time of crisis.""

He references the Venice depicted by the great 18th-century artist, Canaletto:

""If you look at Canaletto now, if climate change progresses at the speed it is now, and if we don't make things better, this Venice will disappear beneath the waters for good.""

""If we think about artists even as recent as Monet, painting in the late 19th century, there is a picture he famously painted from when he was staying at the Savoy in London. The hazy skies in the picture were also products of climate change, even at that time. This landscape, too, will vanish as London potentially disappears beneath the waters.""

Climate change and the climate crisis, for museums, becomes a storytelling frame to understand the new relationship between art history and our futures.

""Climate change and the climate crisis, for museums, becomes a storytelling frame to understand the new relationship between art history and our futures. Those hazy skies and their meaning are something I keep coming back to in terms of the way they change our understanding of the past and of the future.""

Britain's favourite painting, The Fighting Temeraire, by Turner, is one of the great masterworks in the National Gallery:

""It is by far one of our most popular pictures,"" Michaels says. ""The skies he can see have this burning iridescence unique to the artist. Why do they have that iridescence­­­? ""

""Painting at a time of early industrialization, the sky is starting to fill with carbon particulates. Things were starting to happen in the sky that have both shaped our sense of beauty in the way that Turner depicted them, and have also become living documents of a past and how the climate change was starting to happen in places like the UK, 100 to 200 years ago, starting to reshape and redefine what beauty means.

""We, as museums, can help present that to the public, in a world of the climate crisis.

""To me, building new frames for our stories has to be a critical focus. Doing that at the intersection of sustainability and technology is the way we have to go about doing it.""

This, he contends, will need ongoing collective experimentation:

""At the National Gallery, we've taken an approach to how we engage in ongoing collective experimentation through the Innovation Lab I founded in 2019. This is called National Gallery X.""

National Gallery X is a place to think about what the future looks like for museums in a digitising world. A partnership run with King's College, London, the studio provides a space for residencies and events where artists and creatives can explore experimental technologies as well as critical arts, humanities and social science research on culture and the (digital) creative industries, at King's.

This exploration into current King's research, combined with the art and audiences of the Gallery, forms a unique vision of the museum of the future. He explains:

""At National Gallery X, we started to think about what this combination of sustainability and technology might look like. This led to a project that is just about to reach its conclusion, called Home Zero. In September 2020, we put out an open call to artists to bring together arguments, data and research about climate change.""

This creative research project is a partnership between National Gallery X and NESTA, the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts. It aims to help ignite a public conversation about the relationship between household emissions and climate change.

""We asked the artists to tell the public what sustainability might need to look like for the future. We've been delighted to work with two different groups. Love Ssega is a musician and climate activist and Makers of Imaginary Worlds is a Nottingham-based arts installation studio.

""Love Ssega is an astonishing guy, a South London-based rapper, musician and climate activist. I think he is one of the most optimistic, positive voices for change I've ever encountered. He is bringing his arguments to the National Gallery in a series of performances.

""These will, through music and through public engagement, help us think out loud about what a climate-changing world looks like. They will help us very positively share with the public what we can do about it.""

So what, in short, do we have to think about for the future?

""This is a time, frankly, to be scared on lots of levels,"" Michaels concedes. ""However there are positive voices for change. And I think museums can be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. Amidst all these existential threats, change is happening. Digitisation can help us on the way if we bring it together with sustainability in the right way. But only if we act with hope, and act together.""

He concludes with a reference to one last painting:

""It is by the great Renaissance artist Giovanni Bellini and is called the Agony in the Garden. This is a great Christian masterwork from the gallery. To me, it is a picture about hope. It has to be through hopefulness and optimism as well as real positive action that we approach this difficult space that we sit in now together.

""Technology can help us find solutions to the climate crisis. It can help us, as museums, to find ways to communicate with the world, and new ways to solve our own challenges. This is a journey for us all, in the years ahead.""";{'uri': 'blooloop.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Blooloop'}
12;;"What does the metaverse look like? How will it impact our daily lives? How will we access it? MeetKai aims to answer all of these questions with their ""Phase 1 Beta"" metaverse launch designed for mass adoption, with a focus on improving everyday interactions.

The MeetKai Metaverse introduces itself as ""the real world in a smarter virtual space."" This up-and-coming metaverse company stands out from the crowd by offering a unique proposition: a metaverse that's not an escape from reality but an enhancement of it. Essentially, this will be a space where users can engage in everyday activities like shopping, creating, or collaborating, while enjoying unique AI-powered features and VR perks that would be impossible to experience in real life.

MeetKai has given New York City residents and visitors the opportunity to get up close and personal with its metaverse this July. On July 11th, MeetKai turned Times Square's 7th Avenue and 47th Street Billboard into an anamorphic gateway that transports users to the metaversal recreation of Times Square. Once there, they're able to explore a digital replica of New York City with the help of intelligent NPCs and even find portals to an alternate world in Paris.

This Pokemon Go-esque metaverse experience will allow users to see the enhancements that VR can offer in action. Imagine seeing the Mona Lisa at a virtual Louvre without the crowds, while engaging in friendly banter with Leonardo Davinci in smart NPC form. Or picture spending time with a friend in another country, not through a tiny phone screen, but exploring a virtual hyper-realistic beach.

In addition to getting a first look at MeetKai's metaverse, players will be able to seek out and claim a rare ""Key to the City - NYC Edition"" NFT. The key can unlock special features and prizes, and one lucky holder will win the opportunity to have a metaverse street named after them and customized to fit their interests.

MeetKai previously released demos of a number of VR environments, including Beach, Forest, and Zen Garden scenarios during CES 2022, as well as their very own MeetKai NFT Museum. To demonstrate the everyday benefits the metaverse can have, MeetKai also powered AWE's 2022 live metaverse exhibit and released an AR Restaurant Ordering App where users can order with family and friends, and see AR versions of each dish on the menu before they choose.

The Times Square experience showcases one of the unique aspects of MeetKai's metaverse: its accessibility. Users will enter the metaverse simply by scanning a QR code, making it as easy as pulling up a restaurant menu.

""The metaverse should be a place of easy access for everyone, everywhere, without the need for a pricey headset,"" said MeetKai Co-Founder James Kaplan. He notes the lack of affordable hardware as one of his key concerns about the VR industry. His other key concerns, mentioned in an interview with Authority Magazine, also have to do with different types of accessibility. He notes the limitations of metaverse content creation due to a lack of content creation tools, saying that it could pose a significant problem for the industry as a whole.

In addition to the issues of creating and consuming content in the metaverse, Kaplan also cites Web3 limitations as a potential barrier to widespread metaverse adoption. Many people do not have hardware or software crypto wallets, and metaverse platforms will require easier methods of monetization to achieve widespread adoption.

MeetKai is working to address accessibility issues by making the first browser-based metaverse that users can access from a smartphone, PC, or any other type of smart device. The MeetKai Metaverse will also be made accessible with the help of AI-powered virtual NPCs (non-player characters) who can act as instructors, tour guides, store assistants, and other service providers.

These smart NPCs are one of the other aspects that make MeetKai's metaverse unique. The company's roots primarily focus on developing state-of-the-art conversational AI and smart virtual concierge technologies. Unlike other voice assistant products, which use traditional command-based interactions, Kai can understand negation queries, offer multi-language support, and hold natural multi-turn conversations. This offers a more intuitive experience and allows users to engage in purposeful human-like exchanges with AI.

MeetKai's conversational AI work has already shown its ability to make a useful product that helps businesses deliver a better customer experience, using technology to make everyday tasks easier. This is what they aim to do in their metaverse, on a larger scale, and with even more advanced tech.

Unlike most metaverses, which focus on fantastical entertainment or creating immersive sci-fi worlds, MeetKai's metaverse is focused on improving real-life interactions. These include interactions of all kinds, from shopping for clothes to going on a date.

In the early stages of its metaverse, MeetKai is focusing on improving three main types of interactions. The first is e-commerce, which has immense potential for improved and original customer experiences with the help of VR. In the metaverse, you could visit a clothing store entirely tailored to your size and preferences, try clothing on a virtual version of you, and talk with an AI-powered assistant to get your questions answered. In a metaverse homeware store, you could see how items will look in your house before you buy them.

Also critical to the e-commerce world is MeetKai's focus on real-world utility. In addition to letting you see your clothing choices in the metaverse, MeetKai's platform would allow you to actually order those clothes in the VR store and receive them at your real-world doorstep.

MeetKai's real-world utility goes beyond ordering real products. The ability to use VR-enhanced settings can also have a huge impact on real-life productivity. In the metaverse, you can instantly create 3D elements and show them to your co-workers. It will also improve job training processes by allowing workers to practice their tasks in a realistic environment before they get on the job. In addition, AR could also have a major impact on industrial settings, allowing workers to ""see through walls"" and visualize data overlaid in their real environment.

Virtual environments also have the ability to significantly improve the experience of socializing online. Instead of just sitting on the phone for hours, faraway friends, couples, and families can go on virtual hikes or attend virtual painting classes together in the metaverse. These examples highlight one of the key ways that the MeetKai Metaverse aims to enhance real life: by recreating situations that would otherwise be impossible in the real world, with the help of cutting-edge technology.";{'uri': 'coinnounce.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Coinnounce'}
13;;"¿Qué tan cerca estamos de poder habitar un mundo virtual? Lo suficiente como para poder realizar un 'baby shower' en el metaverso.

Aún no ha nacido, pero Thomas, a diferencia de muchos de nosotros, probablemente vaya a saber cómo fue el baby shower que celebraron sus padres. Yo no tengo idea cómo fue el mío, lo más seguro es que hubo una reunión pequeña con regalos, comida y familia; algo simbólico, quizá bonito, pero anodino, a final de cuentas. Thomas, en cambio, tendrá una mucha mejor anécdota: el suyo fue el primer baby shower costarricense -- quizá hasta del mundo -- celebrado en el metaverso.

No es de sorprenderse cuando se toma en cuenta quiénes son sus padres: César Bravo y Desilda Toska, dos ingenieros en sistemas, inventores y fieles creyentes de que esta realidad virtual será más que una simple moda.

La primera vez que conversé con César, me rechazó una llamada telefónica por una propuesta más en línea con el tema: ""Si estás en la compu, ¿qué te parece si te paso un link y nos vemos en el metaverso?"".

Aprovecho el uso de la primera persona para hacer una salvedad: tengo 26 años, pero poseo la noción tecnológica del siglo pasado. Es decir, mi experiencia en el metaverso antes de hablar con César era mínima -- la de alguien que, de lejos, escuchó la apuesta de Mark Zuckerberg y el cambio de Facebook a Meta -- , así que todo lo que les voy a contar a continuación fue visto a través de los ojos de un primerizo, como lo seremos muchos cuando la tecnología lleve este universo virtual al mainstream, de la misma manera que llevó, en su momento, las redes sociales a nuestros teléfonos para cambiar por siempre la manera en la que nos relacionamos con el Internet.

Facebook se rebautiza como Meta para perseguir la creación del metaverso, ¿de qué se trata?

Entrar no fue difícil: basta con darle click al enlace -- un URL común -- y seguir las instrucciones en la creación del perfil, las cuales no varían en gran medida a las que uno seguiría para entrar a una llamada grupal de Zoom, Teams o cualquier plataforma de videollamadas.

Eso sí: hay un cambio importante: uno debe elegir un avatar, el cual será el ""cuerpo"" que tendremos en este mundo virtual. Una vez seleccionado, ya se está listo para entrar en en el universo paralelo que hoy ya tiene un nombre: el metaverso.

Apenas ingresé me recibió César, a quien conocí no por su cara sino por su avatar: un pequeño astronauta de traje naranja con blanco que flota por el lugar. ¿Mi avatar? Una especie de caricatura de un graduado con toga y birrete. Aquí abajo les dejo un ""selfie"" de cómo nos veíamos:

La forma más sencilla de describir el metaverso construido por César y Desilda es compararlo con una especie de videojuego, especialmente como Minecraft o Roblox, todavía con gráficos rudimentarios, pero extraña y acogedoramente inmersivo.

La perspectiva es en primera persona y uno se mueve con el teclado de la computadora, con las teclas W (arriba), A (izquierda), S (abajo) y D (derecha). La ""mirada"" se dirige con el ratón, como si se estuviera ""apuntando"" con él. Esto es en el de caso que uno no tenga unos visores de realidad virtual; de tenerlos, estos se colocarían sobre los ojos y la mirada se dirigiría con la cabeza, es decir, nuestros ojos de la vida real serían nuestros ojos del metaverso, como una especie de simulador. Estos visores mejoran la inmersividad, por supuesto, pero no tenerlos no arruina la experiencia.

Porque, a final de cuentas, eso es el metaverso: un lugar. También me atrevería a decir que ese componente de ""espacio"" es el que más lo diferencia de los encuentros virtuales que nos acostumbramos a tener durante la pandemia por medio de videollamadas.

César y Desilda construyeron este espacio para que los invitados pudieran interactuar con él y recorrerlo como una especie de museo. Hay diferentes salones. Por ejemplo, en el pabellón principal hay dos paredes grandes a ambos lados con las ecografías de Thomas, su bebé, y una pizarra donde los invitados pueden escribir y dejar un mensaje para el recuerdo. También hay un pequeño cuarto con fotos de César y Desilda que está dedicado a contar visualmente cómo fue que se conoció la pareja, y un salón de juegos donde los invitados pueden ""rayar"" una pared para jugar gato.

Mientras hacía el recorrido, César no pudo evitar mostrar cuánto le emocionan las posibilidades de este mundo virtual y paralelo. Se le nota en la voz la energía y el entusiasmo que lo recorre cuando habla de todas sus posibilidades.

-- No se si viste que Facebook cambió su nombre a Meta y, en los negocios, cambiarse el nombre es todo un...

Me habló, también, sobre el caso específico de los bancos, con los cuales tiene experiencia por su trabajo, y sobre cómo quieren evitar que les pase lo mismo que con las criptomonedas: llegar tarde por infravalorar su potencial.

Facebook (ahora Meta) y la banca son solo dos de los actores que ya han empezado a moverse alrededor del potencial que tiene este mundo virtual. Dubái también tiene un proyecto multimillonario para construir una ciudad entera en el metaverso. Incluso empresas que, a primera vista, no tendrían nada que ver con el metaverso como las cadenas de comida rápida -- por obvias razones no se puede comer en la virtualidad -- han empezado a incursionar. Wendy's, creó el Wendysverse, y McDonald´s, en febrero de este año, inscribió diez patentes de sus productos más famosos para comercializarlos en el metaverso.

Una vez terminaron de hacerme el recorrido, César y Desilda me dijeron que ya estaba listo para ir al baby shower, el cual iba a suceder dos días después.

El baby shower se celebró en tractos, pues este mundo virtual todavía no aguanta a demasiadas personas en un mismo lugar al mismo tiempo. ""Sería un caos"", me dijo César, así que se entró en grupos de diez.

En el grupo que me tocó hubo invitados de Costa Rica, Nueva York y Albania. Esa internacionalidad, es, de hecho, una de las razones por la que decidieron celebrar el evento de esta manera: solo así iban a poder invitar a familiares y amigos de diferentes países. César es costarricense y Desilda albanesa, y como ambos han trabajado fuera de sus países, tienen allegados de todas partes del mundo. César calcula que al baby shower asistieron, en total, cerca de diez nacionalidades diferentes.

¿Tiene sentido comprar una ""propiedad virtual""? El metaverso abre la puerta para un nuevo mercado inmobiliario

Una vez que hay más gente en el servidor, se hace todavía más notoria la sensación de ""espacio""; de estar en un lugar, aunque sea virtual, principalmente porque así se aprecia mejor la cualidad espacial del sonido.

En este metaverso el sonido está atado a las reglas físico-virtuales del mundo. Es decir: si el avatar de mi interlocutor se aleja en el mundo que veo a través de la pantalla, yo lo iré escuchando cada vez más bajo hasta que salga de mi radio de escucha. Si se acerca, lo iré escuchando cada vez más fuerte; si se mueve a mi derecha, lo escucharé en mi audífono derecho; y si se mueve a mi izquierda, sucederá lo mismo correspondientemente.

Esto permite que sucedan múltiples conversaciones simultáneamente sin interrumpirse porque, si bien todos están en el mismo servidor, no necesariamente están en el mismo ""lugar"". Yo, por ejemplo, conversé con César en el salón principal mientras que Desilda y su hermana hablaron cerca del área de regalos de la misma manera que podrían darse esas conversaciones en una fiesta en el mundo real, donde cada quien conversa en diferentes habitaciones.

El otro elemento nuevo es el de la experiencia mixta (combinar lo virtual con lo real). Apenas ingresan los invitados, César y Desilda los guían hasta el puesto de comida. ""Mucha gente dice que lo que pasa en el metaverso se queda en el metaverso, pero nosotros no creemos eso, queremos que lo que pase en el metaverso se lo puedan llevar de alguna manera al mundo real y por eso trajimos a Patsy"", dice.

Patsy, fundadora de su emprendimiento Candy Buffet, es una artista en chocolate que, durante el baby shower, se encarga de tomar la orden de los invitados. El proceso para pedir es sencillo: uno se acerca al puesto de Patsy, ella le dice cuáles son las opciones -- el menú está compuesto por ositos de chocolate rellenos de queque bautizados como Metabears -- y, una vez seleccionado el que se quiere, ella se encarga de producirlos y enviarlos por exprés a cada uno.

""César me dijo que me iba a poner un stand en el metaverso y yo no me lo imaginaba, pero sí se pudo. Esto abre las posibilidades de cómo puedo hacer mi negocio en línea"", me dijo Patsy.

Negocios en el metaverso: cómo el entorno virtual abre un mundo de posibilidades para las marcas

El puesto de comidas no es la única interacción mixta del baby shower, también hay una zona de regalos donde uno puede ""dejar"" los presentes, solo que en lugar de un regalo envuelto y tradicional, se da por medio de un código QR que redirecciona a una lista de Amazon donde se compra el obsequio en línea.

La sensación de los invitados fue mayoritariamente positiva en términos de accesibilidad. César y Desilda construyeron este mundo para que fuera lo más amigable con el usuario posible; no hay que instalar ningún programa en la computadora y las instrucciones se encuentran tanto en el sitio web como en las mismas paredes del metaverso. Se puede, incluso, ingresar desde el celular.

""Todavía me cuesta moverme, tal vez la próxima vez que me meta lo haga mejor"", me dijo Lida, la hermana de Desilda, entre risas, mientras trataba, torpe pero fructuosamente, de moverse por las habitaciones. ""Me gustó que lo hicieran aquí porque es el único lugar donde habrían logrado reunir a tanta gente (de diferentes lugares)"".

Todavía no puedo decir que se trata de una experiencia completamente inmersiva y paralela a la vida real, pues la tecnología todavía no ha llegado a ese punto, pero es allí a donde todas las grandes empresas de vanguardia apuntan y César y Desilda, como entusiastas, ya están escribiendo las primeras páginas de esta realidad virtual en el país. Sí me siento más confiado en decir que es una experiencia mucho más ""humana"" que las reuniones por videollamada a las que la pandemia nos acostumbró a estar. Por lo menos así lo sentí

Mucho se habla de que la virtualidad llegó para quedarse.

14;;"Elezioni. Letta, il vero nemico da battere è l'astensionismo, dobbiamo convincere gli indecisi

Metaverso mondi virtuali e tridimensionali nei quali immergersi e con i quali interagire per mezzo del proprio avatar, ovvero una rappresentazione sintetica in forma digitale della propria persona (e della propria personalità).

Quando si parla di metaverso ci si riferisce a una rete di ambienti virtuali e tridimensionali che permettono di immergersi in un mondo digitale attraverso un alter ego sintetico denominato avatar e che consentono l'interazione sociale superando la fisicità del corpo umano, in realtà tali spazi sono costruiti attorno all'elemento chiave dell'interazione sociale poiché questa ne risulta facilitata perché si superano gli ostacoli della distanza fisica presente nel mondo reale e i limiti di una semplice app social. Il metaverso considerato l'evoluzione di internet e anche una potenziale fonte di enormi guadagni e per questo motivo sono sempre di più le aziende interessate a trasformare l'idea in qual

cosa di reale, facilmente accessibile e vendibile.

Nel nostro viaggio alla scoperta del metaverso cercheremo di definire le idee alla base di questa visione futura, le linee guida che caratterizzano lo sviluppo delle tecnologie necessarie per trasformare le diverse visioni su cosa debba essere il metaverso in qualcosa di realmente fruibile, di definire un luogo in cui si trova il metaverso o meglio cosa serve per creare e sostenere un mondo virtuale e di comprendere cosa serve per varcare la soglia che separa la realtà ""vera"" da quella virtuale e quali sono i diversi gradi di interazione possibili. Vedremo anche qual è l'attuale sviluppo della tecnologia e quali sono le aziende più impegnate in questo settore.

L'analisi di ciò che si prospetta come uno degli sviluppi tecnologici più attesi del prossimo futuro non può non tenere conto della storia; solo così è possibile avere un riferimento pèr mantenere la giusta rotta nel corso degli anni richiesti per dare vita al metaverso. La realtà virtuale uno dei tasselli del metaverso è una tecnologia di cui si parla da almeno 70 anni e in più di una occasione è stata indicata come quella predestinata a diventare l'oggetto del desiderio del mercato consumer del futuro. Come sappiamo la realtà virtuale non ha mai avuto il successo preannunciato, almeno fino a oggi. Nel 2014, l'acquisizione di Oculus da parte di Facebook per 2 miliardi di dollari ha riacceso l'interesse verso questa visione futuristica e verso un mondo digitale che sta cambiando pelle. La prima generazione di visori per la realtà virtuale prodotti da Oculus, Sony, Samsung Google e HTC ha catalizzato l'entusiasmo degli appassionati ma è stata comunque una breve parentesi concentrata in un mercato di nicchia. L'incapacità di attrarre il grande pubblico è imputabile alle altissime aspettative poi inattese, alla complessità dei dispositivi, alla necessità di essere fisicamente legati con più cavi a un computer molto potente e a un costo complessivo per molti inaccessibile.

Per questi motivi le aziende del settore stanno abbandonando questo approccio per puntare a qualcosa di potenzialmente più semplice dal' usare cosi da favorirne l'adozione e la diffusione nel mercato di massa. La seconda generazione di visori o la realtà virtuale 2.0 appare più dinamica e orientata al risultato rispetto a quella che l'ha preceduta; questo anche grazie all'enorme potenza di calcolo disponibile in chip sempre più piccoli, economici e progettati ad hoc, a visori connessi con tecnologie wireless, alla disponibilità di strumenti software sempre più evoluti per sviluppare ambientazioni 3D e generare scenari molto vicini alla realtà. Questo cambiamento è stato favorito e permesso dalla disponibilità di servizi cloud all'avanguardia, dall'applicazione di strategie diedge computing, di strumenti per l'intelligenza artificiale, possibilità di tracciamento del movimento fino a pochi anni fa impensabili pensate alla quantità di informazioni generate dagli smartwatch e agli sviluppi nel settore dei dispositivi aptici. Con queste premesse, il metaverso di cui si parla oggi ha il potenziale per replicare il boom della Internet economy affiancando alla vendita di servizi e oggetti anche un'esperienza di vendita e d'uso che l'attuale Rete non è in grado di offrire.

Tutto ciò lascia intravedere possibilità di guadagno degne di una nuova corsa all'oro, una corsa che premierà chi riuscirà a plasmare una piattaforma catalizzante, in grado di abilitare servizi e diversi modelli di vendita. Secondo le principali società di analisi di mercato, questo settore può trasformarsi entro la fine del decennio in un'industria da oltre 30.000 miliardi di dollari con un potenziale di crescita di oltre il 10% ogni anno. Se questo è lo scenario verso il quale ci dirigiamo, assisteremo a repentini cambi di rotta anche in molte strategie aziendali. In questo momento la maggior parte delle aziende sono ancorate a modelli costruiti per l'Internet odierna, uno spazio digitale che ha più volte dimostrato di essere carente in termini di interoperabilità e portabilità dei dati. Mauro Macchi, amministratore delegato di Accenture Italia, ha sottolineato recentemente l'importanza di ""mettersi in gioco e riorganizzare il modo stesso di fare business"".

Questo diventerà possibile se il metaverso sarà sviluppato come spazio totalmente connesso e non come una collezione eterogenea e slegata di servizi. Dopo l'Internet dei dati, quella della condivisione social e 'Internet delle cose si configura all'orizzonte un Internet dei luoghi interconnessi, delle proprietà digitali in cui reale e virtuale potrebbero fondersi senza soluzione di continuità.

Come vedremo nelle prossime pagine, il meteverso è per definizione una pluralità di mondi, teoricamente infiniti mondi virtuali; ancora meglio è la smaterializzazione e digitalizzazione di tutto. Allo stato attuale le aziende impegnate in questo settore investono per sviluppare le fondamenta tecnologiche sulle quali costruire le piattaforme del futuro. Che si tratti di realtà virtuale propriamente detta, di una realtà aumentata o di una proiezione su schermo di un mondo astratto, la promessa del metaverso è quella di consentire la sovrapposizione delle nostre vite fisiche e digitali sotto molti punti di vista: socializzazione, produttività, shopping, intrattenimento, ricchezza e possesso di oggetti unici digitali, sono solo alcuni esempi. Alcuni di questi elementi sono presenti già oggi in forma embrionale in molti videogio chi e piattaforme social. Meta originariamente Facebook è al lavoro sulla piattaforma Horizon dove sono già previste soluzioni per l'interazione social, per realizzare una propria dimora digitale, per l'intrattenimento e strumenti dedicati alla Collaborazione in ambito lavorativo. Un approccio totalmente diverso è quello di Nvidia con Omniverse, una piattaforma che permette di connettere spazi e applicazioni 3D per creare gemelli digitali di singoli prodotti o di interi impianti produttivi così da testarne l'operativa prima ancora di spostare un granello di sabbia nel mondo reale.

Poi c'è tutto il variegato settore del gaming con Epic, Microsoft, Roblox e Vive che tentando di dare forma a un qualche tipo di metaverso dove oltre al divertimento è possibile abbinare il commercio di accessori virtuali utilizzabili all'interno dei videogiochi come Fortnite (Epic). Se da un lato il metaverso nella sua forma astratta può sembrare piuttosto semplice, dall'altro esiste un problema di fondo da risolvere. Per realizzare ciò che promette, il metaverso deve conformarsi come entità neutrale all'interno della quale poi i diversi soggetti persone, gruppi di persone e aziende, possono interagire. Questo aspetto riflette la struttura di Internet, ovvero un ambiente aperto di facile accesso all'interno del quale sono poi presenti servizi di vario genere gestiti da entità pubbliche, private o da singole persone.

Solo così sarà possibile godere appieno dei vantaggi del metaverso tra cui la più importante è l'aggiunta di un elemento di esperienza digitale in contrapposizione a quella analogica della vita reale, ovvero la possibilità di saltare da un contesto a un altro senza passare per contesti intermedi, esattamente come avviene nella navigazione web che permette di collegare di in modo diretto informazioni che non condividono un percorso logico lineare. I tentavi per fare breccia nelle case degli utenti non mancano ma ancora si avvertono i grandi limiti di cui soffre oggi l'ecosistema legato alla realtà virtuale e a quella aumentata. Ciò non toglie che il primo impatto con questi dispositivi è in grado di regalare un'esperienza esaltante, soprattutto se non avete mai avuto occasione di provare i modelli di ultima generazione.

L'esperienza di Internet, degli standard aperti e dell'open source sono la base per sviluppare un metaverso utile, sano e con un lungo futuro. Per quanto il metaverso sia ancora un cantiere a cielo aperto possiamo identificare alcune caratteristiche ormai consolidate e altre che potrebbero o dovrebbero far parte dell'ecosistema finale. In primo luogo dovrebbe essere evidente che il metaverso si profila come una piattaforma in grado di ospitare spazi virtuali tridimensionali ovvero con caratteristiche spaziali del tutto analoghe a quelle cui siamo abituati nel mondo reale. Abbiamo Usato volutamente il termine piattaforma in quanto il metaverso dovrebbe configurarsi come un'entità indipendente o astratta con caratteristiche simili a quelle tipiche di Internet dove la Rete è un supporto che fa da collegamento e da collante tra i servizi creati da singoli soggetti privati, da piccole e grandi società private o da organizzazioni ed entità pubbliche. Di fatto la Rete non ha un vero proprietario, mentre esiste un gruppo di soggetti di varia natura cui è affidato il ruolo di curare i diversi aspetti funzionali e giuridici. Il metaverso dovrebbe configurarsi in modo analogo e non come una piattaforma privata o comunque legata a una singola società o a un ristretto gruppo di aziende; se così fosse assisteremmo al proliferare di metaversi concorrenti che ostacolerebbero lo sviluppo dell'idea originaria.

All'interno del metaverso nellasua forma di piattaforma unica, aperta e condivisa sarà così possibile creare e integrare una moltitudine di spazi o mondi con caratteristiche peculiari, regole di accesso e di funzionamento specifiche ma sempre interconnessi da un substrato comune. Ci saranno cosi mondi dedicati all'intrattenimento, al gioco, allo shopping, business e altri specifici per la produttività. Alcuni di questi mondi potrebbero essere completamente virtuali e altri invece sovrapporsi a quello reale per offrire servizi di realtà aumentata. Pensiamo ad esempio alla possibilità di visualizzare informazioni stradali all'interno dei propri occhiali AR o ancora alla visualizzazione di contenuti di approfondimento durante la visita di un museo o alla sovrapposizione dell'immagine ricostruita dei Fori Imperiali sovrapposta a quella dei resti archeologici mentre ci troviamo in visita a Roma.

L'interconnessione di base potrebbe essere integrata con l'attuale rete di servizi Internet, serve a fornire un sistema di comunicazione e di scambio di informazioni tra le persone connesse al metaverso ma in due mondi diversi e tra il metaverso e il proprio angolo personale del metaverso. Per intenderci le funzioni di base permetterebbero di mandare messaggi, fare chiamate vocali o videochiamate (tra avatar o tra avatar e mondo reale) così come condividere informazioni, documenti o spazi personali. Sarebbe poi possibile salvare contenuti, documenti, fotografie virtuali e così via e archiviarle in un proprio database nel cloud come si fa oggi con i contenuti digitali veicolati via Internet.

Quest'ultimo aspetto mette in luce l'importanza dell'infrastruttura di base che, come gli strati di una cipolla fornisce, livello dopo livello, gli strumenti per offrire servizi ed esperienza d'uso. In questo ruolo le infrastrutture cloud giocano un ruolo chiave, ma vista l'enorme mole di dati in gioco serve una soluzione in grado di operare su più livelli: datacenter centralizzato, datacenter decentralizzati, edge computing ed elaborazione diretta sul dispositivo. Solo una infrastruttura di questo tipo può offrire connettività, banche dati condivise su larga scala, raccolta ed elaborazione di grandissime moli di dati vicino al punto di utilizzo e versatilità d'uso dei dispositivi finali.

Ritorniamo all'esempio di una gita in una città d'arte: i contenuti accessibili in realtà aumentata potrebbero fare riferimento a una banca dati unica in modo che le stesse informazioni siano accessibili sia a chi sfrutta la tecnologia di realtà aumentata sul posto sia a chi visita lo stesso posto in realtà virtuale.

Tali dati per essere accessibili in modo rapido devono essere sincronizzati e decentralizzati su una rete a più nodi; gli stessi dati potrebbero essere aggiornati e sincronizzati in base alle informazioni raccolte dagli occhiali di chi sta visitando il sito d'arte nella realtà. Come potete immaginare la quantità di informazioni in gioco sono enormi quando da un singolo utente si pensa di estendere il concetto a milioni di utenze di cui migliaia potrebbero trovarsi nello stesso posto e generare dati accavallati gli uni agli altri.

Tutto questo vale poi per un singolo ""mondo"", ma il metaverso si prefigge di andare ben oltre a questo. Oggi è quindi ancora difficile definire cosa serve per contenere il metaverso, ma già sappiamo che non sarà in un solo posto, bensì sarà una infrastruttura diffusa con potenze di calcolo, capacità di archiviazione, di raccolta dati e di analisi che è difficile immaginare.

Uno degli elementi chiave del metaverso è l'avatar, ovvero la rappresentazione della nostra identità all'interno della realtà digitale. A differenza della persona fisica, l'avatar non è vincolato a una forma o a caratteristiche predefinite, anche se è lecito immaginare che la forma umanoide sarà quella più diffusa da chi offrirà servizi nel metaverso. Come approtondiamo nella sezione dedicata all'interfaccia uomo-macchina, l'accesso al metaverso richiede un sistema di collegamento tra lo spazio reale e quello digitale.

L'accesso in questo caso potrebbe essere organizzato in diversi livelli a seconda del tipo di interfaccia utilizzata, assicurando che anche il livello minimo abbia accesso ai servizi di interconnessione di base. Pensando al metaverso come a uno spazio in cui si entra e si esce viene da chiedersi cosa succede o cosa potrebbe succedere al proprio avatar e a tutto ciò che è legato alla nostra identità digitale mentre si è disconnessi. Poiché l'avatar del metaverso si configura come una nostra rappresentazione potremmo persino immaginare sistemi di sincronizzazione in modo che l'avatar sia un vero e proprio gemello digitale: pensate banalmente all'uso di una pesa digitale con la quale l'informazione peso non finisca solo nella vostra app di fitness sullo smartphone, ma abbia un qualche tipo di impatto automatico sull'aspetto del vostro avatar.

Il rapporto tra identità reale e avatar è una questione spinosa e tutt'altro che banale, soprattutto se si pensa che nel metaverso sarà possibile creare spazi propri, acquistare oggetti virtuali o reali attraverso l'uso di valute virtuali e reali. Da questa semplice analisi risulta evidente come sia necessario definire standard tecnici compatibili, protocolli, regole di interoperabilità così come una regolamentazione della proprietà digitale attraverso sistemi a torte sicurezza come le tecnologie blockchain. Ora che abbiamo gettato le basi di come potrebbe configurarsi un metaverso, vediamo quali sono le principali implementazioni attualmente in sviluppo.";{'uri': 'agenpress.it', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Agenpress'}

El Parque de Innovación habilitará el próximo miércoles 5 de octubre un espacio virtual dentro del Distrito de los Museos en Decentraland, un universo de post-realidad.

Dicho parque es un espacio en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires que potenciará las actividades de emprendedores, estudiantes e investigadores, y facilitará el encuentro entre ellos y generará sinergias con instituciones innovadoras públicas y privadas del país y del mundo, con especial foco en educación, salud y tecnologías exponenciales.

Al espacio virtual se accederá mediante un enlace y los usuarios podrán participar de un entorno que fusiona la realidad física con la realidad virtual.

El lanzamiento de este nuevo espacio se realizará en el marco de la presentación de Campus Summit, una versión renovada del clásico Campus Party, el evento de tecnología, innovación y emprendimiento más grande del mundo.

Quienes no puedan asistir físicamente al Campus Summit, podrán participar del evento a través de Decentraland, y descubrir en este espacio cómo los eventos virtuales nos permiten ampliar el alcance a una audiencia global.

Decentraland, o Decentralandia en su traducción al español, es un mundo virtual abierto en el que sus usuarios puedan operar tal cual lo hacen en el mundo físico.

Esto significa que son capaces de socializar, explorar y comerciar en este entorno virtual. Incluso comprar propiedades con formato de NFT (token no fungible).

Todo eso es posible a través de la tecnología blockchain de Ethereum, con la cual pueden crear avatares únicos de sí mismos, realizar compras y pagos entre los usuarios de la plataforma.

Además, en este metaverso con adopción global también pueden jugarse videojuegos y a mediano plazo, se espera que lancen una app móvil.

El desarrollo del metaverso, la propuesta popularizada por Mark Zuckerberg. CEO de Meta, a fines del año pasado, suma cada día a nuevas firmas que buscan no quedarse afuera de lo que se presume será uno de los negocios que mayor cantidad de millones de dólares moverá en el transcurso de los próximos años.

Si bien el término metaverso ya existía, fue Zuckerberg el encargado de encarrilarlo y darle la visibilidad (con carácter de oportunidad) que muy pocas empresas y sectores de diferentes industrias conseguían visibilizar hasta ese momento.

Actualmente, la gran mayoría de las empresas entiende que el metaverso es un espacio virtual, más concretamente, un gran mundo virtual y online en el que los usuarios pueden entrar, mejorar, crear o transformar espacios compartidos mediante avatares que los representan. Y, obviamente, relacionarse comercialmente de diferentes formas.

Gigantes de indumentaria, cadenas de comida rápida, firmas de tecnología, clubes deportivos, son algunos de los sectores que ya invirtieron cifras millonarias para expandir su presencia.";{'uri': 'iproup.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'https://www.iproup.com/economia-digital/595-emprendedor-startup-tecnologia-Mercado-Libre-va-de-compras-a-la-provincia-de-Santa-Fe'}
16;;"La comercialización de las Málaga Towers en el metaverso aumenta un 27% sus ventas

Pero lo cierto es que hay un término común que se cuela cada vez con mayor frecuencia en todas y cada una de las elucubraciones que se hacen sobre cómo cambiará uno de los pilares que determinan actualmente nuestra forma de vida.

Ese concepto es el metaverso, un vocablo del que todos han oído hablar desde que Facebook decidió llamarse Meta, pero que tiene una trayectoria muy anterior al anuncio de Mark Zuckerberg y que cuenta con unas posibilidades de desarrollo que aún estar por ver.

En definitiva, el metaverso es un espacio virtual paralelo al mundo real en el que los usuarios, a través de avatares, pueden ir a un museo, viajar, quedar con amigos e incluso comprar una vivienda, aunque eso es solo la punta del iceberg.

En Málaga, pensar en el metaverso supone aterrizar automáticamente el Polo de Contenidos Digitales, donde startups, empresas emergentes o interesadas en especializarse en este sector, están contribuyendo a construir este mundo virtual.

Una de las iniciativas más recientes es la Brújula, un espacio de coworking centrado en el metaverso y la tecnología XR, la Realidad Extendida, creado con el apoyo de la Cámara de Comercio, el Ayuntamiento de Málaga y la Fundación Incyde.

""Nace como iniciativa conjunta con el objetivo de acelerar proyectos y empresas enmarcadas en estos sectores a través de programas gratuitos de acompañamiento, formación, talleres y con acceso libre al equipamiento tecnológico más avanzado para desarrollar sus iniciativas"", explica la concejala del Área de Innovación Digitalización Urbana.

Según destaca el coordinador del proyecto, Chema Galante, La Brújula tiene dos objetivos, por un lado, ayudar a empresas tradicionales a introducirse en los conceptos de metaverso, la realidad virtual, NFT, Blockchain... además de hacer divulgación y poner en contacto a compañías para hacer ""networking"", es decir, encontrar oportunidades entre ellas.

""Servimos de nexo de unión entre empresas para intercambiar experiencias. Eso lo hacemos a través de jornadas de puesta en común, patronales, cada dos meses en polo"", explica Galante.

Entre los proyectos que tienen entre manos en La Brújula destaca, por ejemplo, una academia de peluquerías que acude al coworking porque quiere recrear una escuela en el metaverso en la que sus alumnos puedan practicar los cortes y los tratamientos sin necesidad de gastar dinero comprando pelucas.

Asimismo, se lanzan retos desde empresas privadas o instituciones públicas que necesitan soluciones basadas en herramientas de transformación digital.

Desde que se pusieron en marcha hace apenas cinco meses, han colaborado ya con más de 200 empresas.

En el Polo también ha nació este año ""Metaverso para Principiantes"", el primer podcast en castellano especializado en este espacio virtual.

Ya se escucha en 34 países, con gran relevancia en México y Estados Unidos. Su creador, José González, es miembro del coworking Go2work del Polo, con la colaboración de la Escuela de Organización Industrial y el Ayuntamiento de Málaga.

""Muchos compañeros están desarrollando proyectos tecnológicos que quieren que se desarrollen en el contexto del metaverso. El podcast surge de la propia inquietud de saber de qué estaban hablando"", explica José González, que sostiene que el éxito del podcast se debe al gran interés y, a la vez, en el gran desconocimiento sobre el metaverso, tanto el lúdico como el serio, que es el que más rápido crece. ""Si hablas con los especialistas, no hay una definición todavía normalizada y uniforme de lo que es el metaverso. Cada uno da una visión según su perspectiva. El metaverso en este momento está en construcción"". Puede escucharse a través de su página web y en plataformas digitales.

Uno de los objetivos principales del metaverso es emular la vida real. Una de las invenciones que más se ajustan a esa premisa es la chaqueta háptica desarrollada por la empresa malagueña Owo, que permite experimentar hasta 30 sensaciones físicas en los videojuegos.

Un dispositivo que, por cierto, les llevó a recibir este año el Premio a la Innovación del CES de las Vegas, una de las ferias tecnológicas más importantes a nivel internacional, y que ha catapultado la entrada de su patente en la industria.

""La aceptación de nuestra tecnología por parte del mercado está siendo increíble. Actualmente contamos con más de 8.500 pre reservas de cara al lanzamiento oficial a finales de año y estamos cerrando acuerdos con los mayores y prestigiosos estudios de videojuegos para salir al mercado de manera conjunta"", explica el CEO de OWO, José Fuertes, que celebra haber cumplido el sueño de su juventud: ser el protagonista de un videojuego o de una película.

""No cabe duda que el metaverso será el futuro, pero esta nueva evolución de lo que será internet aún está por construirse"".

La promotora Metrovacesa junto a la startup malagueña Datacasas Proptech se lanzaron a principios de año a promocionar y vender viviendas de la exclusiva promoción ""Málaga Towers"", las tres torres que se están construyendo en el litoral oeste de la capital.

De esta manera, las Málaga Towers, pueden visitarse y comprarse en el metaverso. De hecho, en los primeros cuatro meses desde que se lanzó esta propuesta de comercialización virtual, la promotora aseguraba que las ventas ya habían aumentado un 27%.

""Quisimos ser pioneros en testar que en este universo existe un nuevo modelo de negocio en el que poder demostrar la deseabilidad de compra hacia una vivienda física o virtual, formas de pago e inversión a través de tokens, y todo esto bajo el uso de la tecnología blockchain"", indicaba a este periódico la directora comercial, de marketing e innovación de Metrovacesa, Carmen Chicharro. Una iniciativa que los convirtió en la primera promotora española que comercializa promociones reales en el metaverso.

Las dos torres que está desarrollando Metrovacesa se pueden visitar y adquirir a través de Decentreland, un metaverso descentralizado en el que la promotora cuenta con su propio edificio donde el cliente, con un avatar, puede visitar las promociones e incluso reservar la vivienda si están decididos a comprar.";{'uri': 'laopiniondemalaga.es', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'La Opinión de Málaga'}
17;;"Andrea Cortés, consultora de Llorente y Cuenca, explica los retos que traerá un nuevo modelo de consumo que supone pasar del Internet de las Cosas al Internet de los Sentidos.

El metaverso estará anclado en experiencias reales, no sustituye a la realidad, sino que representa la evolución de esa realidad (...) hay que verlo como una oportunidad, al final del día se trata de conectar el mundo virtual con la realidad física"".

Andrea Cortés, directora de influencia digital en LLYC México.

Los gurús de la tecnología y la inteligencia artificial prevén que en 2030 la mayoría de los internautas pasarán entre 3 y 5 horas del día sumergidos en el metaverso, más o menos el tiempo que hoy muchos adolescentes, y algunos no tanto, pasan en las redes sociales y sobre todo en TikTok.

Ello supondrá un ""salto cuántico"" en los usos de la internet y una verdadera revolución en la manera en que interactuamos socialmente y en nuestros hábitos de consumo.

La palabra metaverso fue creada por Neal Stephenson en su novela de ciencia ficción de 1992 Snow Crash, como el sucedáneo de internet basado en la realidad virtual, donde las personas usan avatares digitales de sí mismas para explorar el mundo en línea.

Recientemente la consultora española Llorente y Cuenca (LLYC) presentó su informe La promesa del metaverso, en el que delinea algunas características y retos de este advenimiento (que ya está aquí pero no acaba de llegar) y que define como ""un hype o una nueva realidad que cambiará nuestras vidas para siempre"".

El informe asegura que ""vivimos un Big Bang Tech"", ya que ""en los últimos 20 años se han desarrollado tecnologías y experiencias que convergen en este momento y cuya implementación en el mercado se ha acelerado exponencialmente debido a la pandemia"" que confinó al mundo durante dos años, lapso que nos ha permitido avanzar lo que habríamos logrado en una década.

Actualmente, gracias al Internet de las Cosas (IoT) podemos hacer muchas operaciones digitales en línea, pero el siguiente paso será hacia el Internet de los Sentidos (IoS), hacia un universo donde virtualmente nuestro avatar pueda ver y hojear un libro, oler un perfume, probar un vino, apreciar una obra maestra en algún museo del mundo desde el sofá de su casa, y sentir el sonido y la brisa del mar como si estuviera realmente presente allí, en una exposición o en una playa.

El Economista conversó sobre este informe con Andrea Cortés, directora de influencia digital en LLYC México, quien advierte que, aunque se aprecia una aceleración tecnológica constante que detonará este boom en 2030, en nuestro país y en otros de la región latinoamericana, sin embargo, la realidad del metaverso será paulatina y tendrá que ver con la conectividad y la infraestructura que seamos capaces de alcanzar, es decir la red 5G, además de la accesibilidad a los productos y la competitividad en los precios, ""eso será decisivo"", asegura Cortés. ""El metaverso no será uniforme, se concretará de maneras distintas, y de acuerdo con los avances en conectividad e infraestructura de cada país"", sostiene.

Para darnos una idea de dónde estamos parados, en Estados Unidos hacen uso cotidiano de internet 302.2 millones de personas (90% de un total de 333 millones de habitantes, en 2021), mientras que los usuarios de internet en México se estiman en 88.6 millones, 76.5% de la población mayor de 6 años, según la ENDUTIH 2021. Un estudio de consumo publicado por Kantar y Iab México revela que los internautas en el país tienen en promedio 4.83 dispositivos electrónicos y se conectan a la red a través 3.86 aparatos (smartphone, 96%, computadora 33.7%, TV o pantalla 22.2%, datos del Inegi de 2020).

Este mismo estudio de consumo refleja que tras la pandemia la intención de compra en línea entre los internautas mexicanos se elevó 7 puntos porcentuales en 2021, para ubicarse en 73 por ciento.

Andrea Cortés señala que ""gracias a la pandemia logramos romper la barrera de la desconfianza para comprar en línea, pero todavía produce inseguridad y vértigo en muchas personas, y esto hace que el reto aún no esté resuelto, por el temor de dejar los datos personales, la huella digital, etcétera, ahí es donde las marcas tendrán que impulsar este cambio para que sus consumidores puedan acceder de manera segura al metaverso, que plantea un nuevo modelo de venta y de consumo.

De acuerdo con el documento de LLYC, el metaverso es una promesa que cambiará la ecuación en el consumo y el comercio digital y se estima que el Mercado Total Accesible (TAM) de la economía del metaverso podría ser de entre 8 y 13 billones de dólares en 2030, con hasta 5,000 millones de usuarios, y aportar 2.8 % al PIB mundial, si evoluciona al ritmo de la tecnología móvil.

Eso significa que las marca tendrán que hacer reingeniería de cara a sus consumidores. ""Las marcas que más van a prosperar serán las que están entendiendo quién es su consumidor, y que están apostando por un nuevo modelo de venta para hacer vivir la experiencia de marca en el metaverso; las que realmente traen una visión de 360° para conectar con la nueva generación. Marcas que se atrevan a probar y a equivocarse"", dice Andrea.

Añade que desarrollar una filosofía de innovación, que ponga en el centro a las personas, será clave en esta transición hacia el nuevo modelo que ""abre una nueva manera de consumo con un nuevo consumidor"".

""Ya nada es como lo conocimos -- dice -- hay que entrar en el chip nuevo de innovar y de adaptarse a los cambios (...) Las marcas tendrán que acompañar a las personas en este proceso. El cambio será gradual, no dejaremos las redes sociales para entrar de repente al metaverso, la clave está en cómo me voy adaptando con lo que hoy tengo para llegar al metaverso mucho más segura, y con una comunidad que me acompañe"".

Otro gran reto será adaptar el modelo de negocio. ""No podemos seguir pretendiendo vender igual como estamos vendiendo hoy, pensando que el consumidor y el medio de consumo es igual. Las marcas tendrán que combinar modelos híbridos de venta física con venta virtual para ir llevando a las personas a este nuevo ecosistema"".

¿Seremos capaces de sumergirnos en el metaverso sin el síndrome FOMO inverso (Fear Of Missing Out, en inglés), por desconectarnos de la realidad?

Andrea Cortés opina que ""hay experiencias que el metaverso no va a poder sustituir del todo, simplemente abrirá nuevas posibilidades; necesariamente el metaverso estará anclado en experiencias reales, no sustituye a la realidad, sino que representa la evolución de esa realidad"".

""Tenemos a nuestro favor que las nuevas generaciones están muy informadas, investigan mucho antes de comprar, se decantan por marcas que son afines a sus principios o convicciones, si impactan en el medio ambiente, si tienen ambientes laborales dignos, etcétera; es una generación mucho más consciente de la salud mental, y hoy tenemos también la ventaja de que los lineamientos éticos en el metaverso ya están pensados de antemano y eso las marcas deberán tomarlo en cuenta, para transmitir confianza a sus consumidores, cuidando más a las personas y al entorno social que a las propias marcas.

""Al metaverso hay que verlo como una oportunidad, al final se trata de conectar el mundo virtual con la realidad física"", concluye.

El metaverso una ""representación tridimensional, inmersiva y conectada de Internet. Un universo virtual persistente (seguirá existiendo estemos o no en él), social (podemos relacionarnos e interactuar con otros) y descentralizado (no están en manos de una única entidad o plataforma) en el que los consumidores son capaces de saltar entre diferentes experiencias virtuales, o entre la representación virtual y real del mundo físico"".";{'uri': 'eleconomista.com.mx', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'El Economista'}
18;;"FRANKFURT: From your sofa, climb Mount Everest, visit a museum in New York or dive through a coral reef in the ocean: Virtual experiences have received an enormous boost from the pandemic.

This has not gone unnoticed by the travel and leisure industry. No longer is the technology being used just for their marketing, but also as an event product. Is the hype here to stay? And if so, where is the journey heading?

Two researchers - Armin Brysch, who researchers this topic at Kempten University of Applied Sciences, and Tristan Horx, who studies new trends at the Zukunftsinstitut (future institute) in Frankfurt - share their thoughts about the future of virtual reality travel.

Madrid as a virtual experience

If you look at virtual travel, it quickly becomes clear that the industry is only just trying its hand at it. For example, the Tourism Authority of Madrid, has begun offering a virtual experience to see the Spanish capital even before the actual trip.

A visitor needs to book a 30-minute appointment on the authority's website, with the tour using a video phone call via zoom. Once connected, a tour guide surfs through the streets of Madrid, stopping at places when the visitor has some questions.

Soon, 360-degree images appear, with the tour guide zooming in, for example the Royal Palace. The service does provide a useful first impression of a city, but it really does not amount to a virtual reality (VR) experience.

So what is the VR experience?

VR travel requires a ""computer-generated, virtual, three-dimensional environment that you perceive with VR glasses,"" explains Armin Brysch of the Kempten University of Applied Sciences in Germany.

Shielding all outside light by means of the VR glasses - in what is called a ""cave,"" or a room fully equipped with monitors - is necessary for the viewer to be completely surrounded by the virtual world.

""The deeper the traveller is immersed in the world provided him, the more realistic the artificial experience is,"" says Brysch. Experts call this ""immersion,"" requiring high-resolution images and an exciting narrative.

On a virtual journey through time

Even if some tourism experts still call virtual reality travel a niche development, there is no doubt that something is afoot. With Timeride, for example, you can go on a virtual journey through time and immerse yourself in the life of earlier eras.

In Germany, people can take the Timeride in Cologne, Berlin, Dresden, Munich and Frankfurt. The Berlin Timeride takes the traveller through Berlin of the 1980s, when The Berlin Wall still divided the city.

""Many large art museums also use VR applications,"" Brysch notes. He assumes that the offerings are here to stay. ""While we now have a desire for social experiences, the technology will hold its own.""

In the Ruhr region's industrial city of Essen, there is a mixed reality city tour called ""Essen 1887."" Here, visitors are guided through the city with GPS and special glasses, with holograms popping up at certain points along the way.

Suddenly, people from the year 1887 are talking to you while horse-drawn carriages are driving through the streets. The difference to virtual reality in this case is that you are on the move in the virtual surroundings and yet also still perceive the real world - something known as augmented reality (AR).

Now, get ready for some travel in the 'metaverse'

Does all this have a future? According to a recent survey by Bitkom Research, it would appear so. The next big thing is the ""metaverse"" - the virtual space that expands on today's internet and in which one moves and interacts as an avatar, a digital model of oneself.

The Bitkom survey found that 21% of respondents aged 16 and over expect to explore foreign places with the help of VR goggles in 2030 instead of travelling there in the traditional way. The proportion is higher among younger people, but even among the over-64 age group, 15% share this view.

Virtual reality travel was boosted by the pandemic, but is it here to stay?

Without a doubt, the pandemic has fuelled virtual travel offers. When travel was not possible when stringent restrictions were in place, many wanted to escape everyday life - even if only digitally - and go to exotic places. At the very least, the pandemic era has increased trust in digital products, says Armin Brysch. People have learned to manage their everyday lives well with digital solutions.

Tristan Horx takes a more critical view. The young trend researcher at Germany's Zukunftsinstitut believes that VR offerings which existed during the pandemic era are no longer being used to the same extent. ""That was due to hype and a lack of alternatives,"" he says about VR-aided travel. But he adds that though people live in a digital world, people themselves are analogous.

Therefore, you can't ""move everything into the digital,"" Horx says. Especially those things which are already perfect in reality. ""A visit to a museum is not just the visual consumption of works of art, but an overall experience,"" Horx argues. This is something that might get a bit lost in the digital world.

Virtual reality for holiday planning

Nevertheless, Horx does not completely dismiss virtual reality in the tourism sector. ""It will remain where it makes sense,"" he says, and cites travel advice one example. ""By looking at four places with VR glasses and then deciding on one, that can work,"" Horx said about choosing a destination. His remark should please the tourism experts in Madrid.

The question remains whether virtual travel will replace real travel.

Armin Brysch is sure it won't: ""Just because we can look at the destination in 3D, we won't give up going there."" For some target groups, however, there could be trade-offs, he says. For example, those people who cannot travel everywhere due to physical limitations. Or for people for whom travel is too expensive, stressful, dangerous or harmful to the climate. ""VR can create a substitute experience,"" Brysch says. - dpa";{'uri': 'thestar.com.my', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Star '}
19;;"The UAE economy ministry was setting up shop inside the metaverse.

The Dubai-based Emirates Airlines is set to train its next batch of nearly 4,000 cabin crew members in the metaverse. The move could ease the pressure by taking some in-person training sessions into the metaverse.

Speaking at the Dubai Metaverse Assembly last week, the chief operating officer (COO) of Emirates, Adel Ahmed Al Redha, explained that the A350 commercial aircraft is being configured in Humboldt, USA. The metaverse and virtual reality would be used to simulate walking into the aircraft and analyzing every detail.

We used metaverse, virtual reality and walked into the aircraft and looked at every detail, every gap in the aircraft, whether it is in the galley or with the seats. We have configured an aircraft and what we see there today is exactly what we'll see in 2024.

However, the trainees will still have to attend the airline's state-of-the-art aviation training college in Dubai to complete practical hands-on sessions such as aircraft evacuation, ditching, and medical emergency scenarios.

The crown prince of Dubai, Hamdan bin Mohammed, also attended the Dubai Metaverse Assembly.

At the same time, the economy ministry of UAE was reportedly setting up a shop inside the immersive virtual world that is now taking shape. Speaking at the Dubai Metaverse Assembly held at Dubai's Museum of the Future, Abdulla bin Touq al-Marri, UAE's Minister of Economy, said:

We trained our employees to really immerse themselves in the metaverse, use the metaverse and engage with the Generation Z that is going to come.

Al Marri further added that organizations and employees in Dubai had been trained to immerse themselves in the metaverse, use the metaverse and engage with the Generation Z that is going to come.

20;;"From virtual worlds to digital economies, the metaverse is the next phase of the internet. CNN's Anna Stewart meets the key players working in this space on her journey to decode the metaverse.

Neal Stephenson coined the term 'metaverse' over three decades ago in his book Snow Crash, based in a dystopian future where people used VR headsets to escape to an alternative reality. He explains his use of the term: ""I thought it sounded cool. Meta - you know, was starting to come into its own as kind of a hip prefix for things. It just means beyond, you know, or at the end of. And so, I just rammed it together with universe and here we are.""

Nowadays, people and companies are building new worlds ranging from computer generated environments to immersive experiences inside virtual reality.

In 2021, Facebook changed its name to Meta. Anna Stewart meets The Chief Technology Officer of Meta, Andrew Bosworth, in Horizon Workrooms, a Virtual Reality social platform that Meta is currently building.

Bosworth defines the metaverse as ""the next evolution of the internet, this rich environment where you have a real sense of place and a real sense of presence with other people and it feels more like we're together. The metaverse is the next big bet that we believe will be a huge part of human life"". When Stewart highlights recent security and data concerns surrounding the metaverse, Bosworth says ""Nobody is more focused on this problem than Meta is.""

Other platforms that have been in the field for much longer, include Second Life. Founder Philip Rosedale has been concerned about privacy issues since the inception of the metaverse. He tells CNN, ""The most dangerous thing you could do in the metaverse is to enable surveillance and behavioral tracking and targeting and advertisement in the way that we've seen in social media.""

Instead of making money from user data, Second Life generates revenue through the sale of virtual goods, real estate and services which saw 345 million transactions last year. The platform also allows users to create those types of assets for themselves - something that has been done more than two billion times, according to the company. Stewart experiences this economy first hand when Philips invites her virtual shopping. He says, ""Second Life's GDP is about 650 million dollars a year...there are thousands of people in Second Life, whose real-life living is made by the work that they do here.""

The potential of the metaverse as an extremely lucrative space is also explained by Sam Huber, CEO of LandVault. He owns hundreds of real estate plots in more than a dozen worlds and says that some have been rented out for upwards of 60 thousand dollars a month to big brands and corporations. Stewart asks him if brands really know though what the value is yet in the Metaverse, are they wasting their money investing in a space they maybe don't fully understand yet? He replies, ""No, definitely not. I mean, history has proven that being early, testing and learning is definitely a way to capture disproportionate advantage.""

There are businesses in Dubai that are heeding Sam's advice. Ali Sajwani is the general manager of real-estate company Damac, a property developer that will invest up to 100 million dollars to build a digital city. ""What we're doing is unique. We're building virtual properties to enable you to buy the real property. To give you a feel of what it's like to own the real asset."" When a customer buys a home from Damac, they'll receive the digital version of it as well, where ""you can chat to your neighbors, you can meet with them online [and] have discussions with them.""

CNN also meets Ten24, a company that wants to create a database of avatars for future users. Founder, James Busby, tells Stewart, ""What will happen is AI will come to a point where you can take a photo of yourself it will look at a library like ours and draw in the bits that look like you and from that photograph will create an avatar that looks like you.""

Stewart tries out state-of-the-art motion capture technology to control her avatar in real time. VR headsets aren't yet advanced enough to track facial features, so iPhones are used instead to capture facial expressions. Co-founder at Kite & Lightening, Cory Strassburger, shares his thoughts on artificial intelligence (AI), ""I'm seeing AI, artificial intelligence, doing amazing things recently that are changing my perception of how long some of this is going to take. In the not-too-distant future, people at home will be able to do a similar body capture just using a webcam. The VR headset will capture their face. And we can do what we're doing now, but the right way - immersed in some cool environment.""

Exploring what psychological impact this will this have on us, futurist and editor of a book on digital ethics, Dr Jane Thomason has dedicated the last couple years to researching the metaverse. Anna Stewart meets her inside Dubai's Museum of The Future where a section called Al Waha is a space meant to give visitors a break from digital life. On the health implications of spending time at the Metaverse, Thomason says ""The real life and the digital need to be integrated in a way that's healthy for you. Other kinds of issues are obviously around privacy and security, consumer protection. Should children be allowed in the metaverse?"".

Thomason believes that these problems will have to be addressed by governments as some of the metaverses will be multi-jurisdictional. She says, ""there needs to be a whole new set of thinking around regulation for the metaverse."" She also shares that the metaverse ""is already being used to treat anxiety and mental health and to help people relax.""";{'uri': 'albawaba.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Al Bawaba'}

27;;"A KPMG report surveyed 2,200 global executives to get a better idea of tech trends and the challenges facing businesses today.

More than two-thirds of global businesses will embrace emerging technologies such as Web3, the metaverse and quantum computing within the next two years, a new KPMG report has found.

Despite high inflation and economic uncertainty looming over the heads of many businesses across the world, the KPMG Global Tech Report 2022 published today (29 September) has found that there is a strong appetite among executives to invest in new technologies.

After surveying more than 2,200 tech executives across the globe, the report found that 67pc of businesses are set embrace emerging areas of technology such as crypto, the metaverse, Web3, NFTs, quantum computing, VR/AR, 5G and edge computing by 2024.

While nearly all (99pc) business agreed that they have benefited from digital transformation, more than half (58pc) reported that they are 'behind schedule' on cybersecurity. Nine out of 10 businesses, however, said they are 'advanced' in their adoption of cloud systems.

Talent shortage has emerged as the leading challenge facing businesses across the world and complicating the adoption of emerging technologies. Demand for talent has long outstripped supply in tech sectors such as IT and cybersecurity across most of Europe, including Ireland.

The report also found that improving customer experience was top of the agenda for more than half (57pc) of the of businesses going through digital transformation.

""Customer experience is substantially motivating enterprise investments in IT and is becoming synonymous with digital transformation,"" said Barry Brunsman, global leader of CIO Center of Excellence at KPMG International.

""Tech strategies are anchored to creating loyalty-winning experiences, to safeguard income and encourage high levels of repeat revenue from customers.""

Confidence high but challenges many

Most tech leaders surveyed are confident about what they can achieve through digital transformation and their ability to capitalise on technologies. 66pc of respondents believe they are either 'extremely' or 'very' effective in using tech to advance their business strategies.

Sedef Gavaz of the UK's Natural History Museum, who was one of the respondents in the report, said that she sees potential in the metaverse to 'completely transform' the museum experience.

""Every technology investment needs to ladder back up to your strategy and mission, and the metaverse fits very comfortably within one our strategy pillars: reaching and engaging the widest audience,"" said Gavaz, who is the head of digital product at the museum.

While lack of talent in areas such as data science and engineering was the biggest challenge for businesses, the high cost of adding new systems and talent was the second most commonly reported challenge (32pc).

This was followed by lack of skills to implement or fully take advantage of new systems (29pc), sub-optimal data management (28pc) and a risk-averse corporate culture that is 'slow to embrace change and disruption (24pc).

28;;"DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates (UAE), which already boasts the world's tallest skyscraper and has launched a bold Mars mission, now hopes to become a pioneer in the depths of the metaverse.

In a project launched at Dubai's gleaming Museum of the Future, it announced that the UAE's economy ministry was setting up shop inside the immersive virtual world that is now taking shape.

Those who don their virtual reality goggles or use other means to venture within will find a ministry open for business with companies and even ready to sign bilateral agreements with foreign governments, officials said.

The metaverse is an online world where users will eventually be able to game, work and study, its proponents say - although it is still in a ""test"" phase, the UAE's economy minister conceded.

Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri was speaking at the inaugural Dubai Metaverse Assembly, held at the museum whose innovative ring shape decorated with Arabic calligraphy flanks the city's main thoroughfare.

""In the last couple of years we've seen investments, we've seen companies move in, and with the changes of the (visa) regime ... we see talent coming in,"" Al Marri told AFP in an interview.

""We trained our employees to really immerse themselves in the metaverse, use the metaverse and engage with the Generation Z that is going to come,"" he added.

The UAE, which has a history of bold projects including the 830-metre Burj Khalifa, hopes the metaverse can add US$4bil (RM18.59bil) to annual gross domestic product and 40,000 jobs to its workforce by 2030.

In its bid to become one of the world's top-10 metaverse economies, Dubai wants to attract 1,000 companies specialising in blockchain and related technologies, helped by eased visa rules for freelancers, entrepreneurs and creatives.

As the coronavirus pandemic pushed more people into the online world, ""Covid really accelerated"" the trend, Al Marri added.

""We trained our employees to really immerse themselves in the metaverse, use the metaverse and engage with the Generation Z that is going to come,"" he added.

The UAE, which has a history of bold projects including the 830-metre (2,723-foot) Burj Khalifa, hopes the metaverse can add $4 billion to annual GDP and 40,000 jobs to its workforce by 2030.

In its bid to become one of the world's top-10 metaverse economies, Dubai wants to attract 1,000 companies specialising in blockchain and related technologies, helped by eased visa rules for freelancers, entrepreneurs and creatives.

As the coronavirus pandemic pushed more people into the online world, ""Covid really accelerated"" the trend, Al Marri added.

47;;"DUBAI, Oct 3 -- The United Arab Emirates, which already boasts the world's tallest skyscraper and has launched a bold Mars mission, now hopes to become a pioneer in the depths of the metaverse.

In a project launched at Dubai's gleaming Museum of the Future, it announced that the UAE's economy ministry was setting up shop inside the immersive virtual world that is now taking shape.

Those who don their virtual reality goggles or use other means to venture within will find a ministry open for business with companies and even ready to sign bilateral agreements with foreign governments, officials said.

The metaverse is an online world where users will eventually be able to game, work and study, its proponents say -- although it is still in a ""test"" phase, the UAE's economy minister conceded.

Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri was speaking at the inaugural Dubai Metaverse Assembly, held at the museum whose innovative ring shape decorated with Arabic calligraphy flanks the city's main thoroughfare.

Representatives of tech giants mingled with entrepreneurs and developers exploring the potential of the metaverse, a network of digital spaces intended as an extension of the physical world.

""In the last couple of years we've seen investments, we've seen companies move in, and with the changes of the (visa) regime... we see talent coming in,"" Al Marri told AFP in an interview.

""We trained our employees to really immerse themselves in the metaverse, use the metaverse and engage with the Generation Z that is going to come,"" he added.

The UAE, which has a history of bold projects including the 830-metre Burj Khalifa, hopes the metaverse can add US$4 billion (RM18 billion) to annual GDP and 40,000 jobs to its workforce by 2030.

In its bid to become one of the world's top-10 metaverse economies, Dubai wants to attract 1,000 companies specialising in blockchain and related technologies, helped by eased visa rules for freelancers, entrepreneurs and creatives.

As the coronavirus pandemic pushed more people into the online world, ""Covid really accelerated"" the trend, Al Marri added.

Those who don their virtual reality goggles or use other means to venture within will find a ministry open for business with companies and even ready to sign bilateral agreements with foreign governments, officials said.

The metaverse is an online world where users will eventually be able to game, work and study, its proponents say -- although it is still in a ""test"" phase, the UAE's economy minister conceded.

Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri was speaking at the inaugural Dubai Metaverse Assembly, held at the museum whose innovative ring shape decorated with Arabic calligraphy flanks the city's main thoroughfare.

Representatives of tech giants mingled with entrepreneurs and developers exploring the potential of the metaverse, a network of digital spaces intended as an extension of the physical world.

""In the last couple of years we've seen investments, we've seen companies move in, and with the changes of the (visa) regime... we see talent coming in,"" Al Marri told AFP in an interview.

""We trained our employees to really immerse themselves in the metaverse, use the metaverse and engage with the Generation Z that is going to come,"" he added.

In its bid to become one of the world's top-10 metaverse economies, Dubai wants to attract 1,000 companies specialising in blockchain and related technologies, helped by eased visa rules for freelancers, entrepreneurs and creatives.

57;;"Corma New Media, a Taiwan-based virtual production company, has successfully offered multiple immersive virtual experiences in digital art exhibitions that connect historical facts with entertainment experiences.

Taipei City, Taiwan - September 26, 2022 --

As the metaverse blurs the boundaries between physical and virtual worlds, there is no doubt the application of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies in museums and galleries is becoming mainstream. Corma New Media, a Taiwan-based virtual production company, has successfully offers multiple immersive virtual experiences in digital art exhibitions. They believe that VR innovations will fundamentally transform the people's view of the world.

Since its founding in 2006, Corma New Media has launched a range of Virtual Reality experiences, with an aim to allow people to be completely immersed in an interactive adventure. It produces software that integrates multi-person interaction technology and a back-end database to create an extensible interactive virtual reality platform for multiuser.

""VR technology will play a significant role in museums and art exhibitions,"" says Ray Lee, the CEO of Corma New Media. For example, National Palace Museum houses nearly 700,000 collections of precious Chinese artefacts. It will take at least 11 years to display the entire collection in the limited space available. However, through the adoption of multi-person interaction and full body motion capture technology, it is possible to break the limits of time and space and allow visitors to immerse themselves in playful digital exhibitions.

A game-changing project in Daxi Wood Art Ecomuseum provides visitors with a mixed physical and virtual experience. Through interactive design, Corma New Media used VR technology to bring visitors back to the glamorous past of Taiwan, where they can role-play historical celebrities, take photos, capture virtual monsters and more. While learning about the history of the old town Daxi, the project enables visitors to explore historic sites both virtually and physically.

With more and more museums and galleries have been embracing interactive displays to enhance their storytelling potential and bring an extra dimension to their collections, Ray believes VR is a big trend in exhibition. One of the benefits of VR is that it can create lasting experiences instead of temporary physical collections. It also helps curators to put objects in different contexts or show their true scale. When a museum digitizes its entire collection, curators can easily establish digital exhibition spaces according to different themes and numbers of visitors, Ray says.

Like the other part of the world, the outbreak of Covid-19 has undoubtedly accelerated the adoption of immersive technologies. Another successful project of Corma New Media is the first ever AR live concert of Namewee, a Malaysian rapper. During the pandemic, the concert was made possible with the use of the latest AR technology. Ray explains, owing to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, Namewee couldn't travel to Kaohsiung. However, Corma New Media created a virtual AR stage, where Namewee recorded the concert in Malaysia, while Yahoo TV produced the live show in Taiwan. The reaction from audiences has been encouraging, with nearly 20,000 people watched online.

Apart from culture and entertainment, Corma New Media also adopts VR and AR technology in military training and medical education. Training military and medical personnel have never been easy, which is why AR technology can be viewed as a simulation tool to enhance the effectiveness of training. Currently, Corma New Media has worked closely with militaries and hospitals to develop educational training programs. The feedback from participants is rewarding.

Given that the medical personnel training is universally applicable, Corma New Media are also planning to enter the Southeast Asian healthcare market with their AR advanced medical training programs. ""We hope to share the positive experience and advanced technology of Taiwan to Southeast Asian countries and help them train more professional healthcare practitioners."" Ray says.

Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy in collaboration with the SEE Institute, has launched the Future of the 'Digital Economy: Business in the Metaverse' academy, the first-of-its-kind specialised training programme designed to equip digital startups with practical knowledge and tools they need to build in the metaverse and leverage Web3 to their benefit.

A total of 30 businesses from Dubai and other markets will be selected to join the training academy, which utilises VR, AR and XR technologies to help participants experience and understand the dynamics of business in the metaverse.

During the training, participants will go through four sessions covering the core principles of Web3, its history and roots and case studies of Web3 business strategies that have succeeded and failed.

In addition, sessions will look at the value of NFTs as a new way of communication between brands and customers and how to manage expectations of different blockchains.

Upon completion of the programme, participants will benefit from mentorship support in Dubai, and gain access to a free sustainable co-working space, while they will also have the opportunity to share their success stories with an audience at Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy's biggest events in 2023.

Khalid Al Jarwan, executive director of Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy, said that the training academy aligns with the chamber's strategy to support the growth of the digital economy sector, attract high-potential digital companies to Dubai and cement the emirate's position as a preferred digital economy hub.

Dr Jasmina Locke, CEO of the SEE Institute, said: ""The creation of the metaverse has caused a major disruption to business models both within the UAE and internationally, as organisations are increasingly becoming part of the metaverse by using blockchain, NFTs, cloud technologies and more. The notion of a hybrid world is a reality and it has triggered the transformation of our digital economy.""

""SEE Institute is well positioned to help companies navigate the emerging metaverse opportunities and how they align with psychological and behavioral aspects that drive Web3. In the metaverse programme, the student will learn about crypto wallets, NFTs, building communities around Web3, and the best digital practices in 2022 and how they will pave the way to a more sustainable society,"" she added.

Eligible digital startups will have until October 31 to apply for the training programme, which will run between December 5- 14.

In other news, organised by the Dubai Future Foundation, the Dubai Metaverse Assembly was held on September 28-29 at the Museum of the Future and AREA 2071 in Emirates Towers, Dubai. The two-day event is bringing together regional and international experts in Dubai to shape the future of the metaverse and explore its promise and potential applications.

In the wake of George Floyd's murder, local entrepreneur Amir Berenjian and his team wanted to create a safe and accessible space to talk about some of the Twin Cities' challenges, including its racial equity gaps, which are among the largest in the country.

Berenjian describes what his St. Louis Park company, REM5, created as akin to a ""virtual social justice museum"" -- an exhibit in the metaverse. Similar to a computer game, people can walk through a virtual gallery of information and images on their home browsers.

REM5 is working with Target, General Mills, HandsOn Twin Cities, the University of St. Thomas and others to make the ""1 City. 2 Realities"" virtual experience part of employee training.

REM5 was founded in 2018 with the idea to make the technology of virtual reality more available to the masses.

The company launched the virtual exhibit on a new digital platform that Berenjian hopes can eventually evolve into an easy interface for clients to build their own immersive learning and development experiences within the metaverse without the help of a developer.

""We believe that the metaverse, this next generation of this spacial web is a really, really powerful tool, but it's not accessible for most people so how do we build these tools that empower a company like a Target,"" he said.

""Think of it like the Wix [website design builder] for the metaverse,"" he said.

A few decades ago, people needed to hire web developers to build simple blogs or websites. Now, design applications allow novices to quickly create a fully functioning site.

REM5 has a brick-and-mortar lab in St. Louis Park where people can host events and rent time to play games with the help of virtual reality headsets. It also has a REM5 Studios creative agency and REM5 For Good arm in which it creates virtual experiences for education, corporate training and beyond.

It has used virtual reality to help with other diversity and equity training in the past. But in summer 2020, after Minneapolis became the center of a racial reckoning that swept the world, the REM5 team developed the ""1 City. 2 Realities"" experience.

""I had all this data that basically told this story of Minneapolis and Minnesota and how we hold ourselves up as 'Minnesota nice' and best parks and greatest places to live, yada, yada, but when you start to look at the data around wealth gaps, education gaps, incarceration rates, redlining, we are like the bottom five,"" he said.

People choose an avatar to ""walk"" through several gallery rooms with statistics, photos and videos that include murals painted across Minneapolis; a map of minority neighborhoods that were redlined as high-risk for mortgage lending; and 360-degree photo spheres that allow the user to

The experience is done through a web browser. REM5, which had been known for its experiences with virtual reality headsets, had to adjust during the pandemic to engage users remotely without them having to wear headsets and be in the same room.

By Kwon Mee-yoo

The Embassy of Israel in Korea opened in the metaverse, becoming the first diplomatic mission in the country to gain a presence in the virtual world.

On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Korea and Israel, the Israeli Embassy opened a pavilion in the metaverse to offer information about Israel and promote exchanges between the two countries.

""The Israel-Korea Metaverse is a truly unique platform for sharing a virtual reality immersive experience, the history of Israel-Korea relations and also for carrying out all kinds of interesting interactions between Israelis and Koreans. Even though they are 8,000 kilometers apart, yet in the metaverse, they are right next to each other,"" Israeli ambassador to Korea Akiva Tor said during a launching event at a hotel in Seoul, Sept. 20.

According to the embassy, there is no other embassy metaverse with this level of functionality existing anywhere in the world at this time. The embassy developed this with a Korean company called Vrillar.

""I'm quite sure that this is the way forward. It won't be the only tool of public diplomacy and, of course, we will always want to bring real people to Korea and to hold in-person conferences and in-person cultural performances. But I think the embassy metaverse will become the essential standard just as websites became the essential standard about 20 years ago and SNS channels are now,"" the ambassador said.

""The more I think about the potentialities of this breakthrough platform and how it can grow, the more exciting it seems... We'll create new avenues of interaction for people at far distances, like Israelis and Koreans at the opposite ends of Asia.""

The pavilion's exterior is inspired by the Shrine of the Book in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Upon entering the pavilion, the German-born Jewish theoretical physicist, Albert Einstein, welcomes visitors and gives a brief introduction of the pavilion. Einstein is voiced by Michael Reiffenstuel, the German ambassador to Korea.

On the first floor is a gallery introducing the 60-year history of Korea-Israel relations with an olive tree in the center, bringing Israel's national tree to the virtual world.

The virtual space is open for various events and activities, including the MC2 lounge on the second floor, and the ambassador hopes more people will visit and use the pavilion.

""Our challenge as an embassy will be to make this innovative functionality popular in Korea and in Israel, for the people young at heart and open to a new experience of engagement,"" Tor said.

""I'm thinking of a metaverse with Hebrew and Korean language clubs, an Israel Film Festival, virtual meetings of the student clubs of Israel and Korea, a hangout for lovers of K-pop and the Hebrew Bible, a place for talk and debate about archaeology and the future of autonomous vehicles.""

The embassy plans to continuously update the Israel-Korea Metaverse.

63;;"The recent launch of Dubai's Metaverse Strategy by H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of Dubai Executive Council, positions the city as a global pioneer offering the world's most advanced and connected ecosystem where the metaverse community can thrive in a dynamic and enabling environment.

The move consolidates Dubai's status as a global capital of advanced technologies, primarily artificial intelligence (AI) and Web3.

Dubai is already home to more than 1,000 companies in the metaverse and blockchain sector. As the city attracts new players, the sector's current contribution of US$500 million to the economy is estimated to increase significantly. The Dubai Metaverse Strategy aims to support more than 40,000 virtual jobs by 2030 and add $4 billion to Dubai's economy in five years.

The emirate is rapidly making headway with its metaverse strategy, announcing the formation of a Higher Committee for Future Technology and Digital Economy chaired by Sheikh Hamdan. The objective of the committee is to consolidate Dubai's status as a global digital economy hub.

The committee will design policies, analyse trends and supervise the implementation of strategies related to the digital economy and future technologies, including the metaverse, AI, blockchain, Web3, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), the Internet of Things (IoT), data centres and cloud computing.

Dubai's specialist Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) formulated a Test-Adapt-Scale model that has proven to be a compelling proposition for global future economy companies. The model is a magnet for net-zero, high-value-add, technology-driven firms that are migrating to Dubai. The city seeks to become one of the top 10 metaverse economies and a global pioneer in adopting digital solutions, aiming to increase the number of blockchain companies by five times.

Among significant players moving to Dubai to join the VARA's exclusive regime open to a limited number of licensees are some of the world's largest and most credible virtual assets exchanges, such as Binance, FTX, crypto.com, Coinbase and Bybit. This is in addition to traditional finance icons offering DeFi (decentralised finance) solutions like Galaxy Digital, Komainu, and Brevan Howard, native crypto service providers, and home-grown virtual assets enterprises like BitOasis and CoinMENA.

Experts envision Web3 as the decentralised and democratised version of Web2, the current iteration of the Internet. Many believe it will include ""crowd-owned"" social media platforms, search engines and marketplaces, replacing the current ""corporate-owned"" format.

Dubai's metaverse leadership Dubai is the world's first and only jurisdiction with the foresight to set up a dedicated virtual assets regulator. In March this year, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, approved Dubai's Virtual Assets Law (VAL) and established the VARA, firmly cementing Dubai's leadership in the sector. The law ensures much-needed investor protection, economic security, and market transparency, backed by fully traceable and non-deletable transaction records.

Helal Al Marri, Director-General of the Dubai World Trade Centre Authority, which houses VARA, said, ""Virtual assets are transforming the financial world and are set to be the primary drivers of the future global economy. The VARA regime is structured to catalyse collaboration and prioritise public protection.""

Dubai is a pioneer in several new-age business sectors like FinTech and eCommerce. The Economist's Digital Cities Index 2022 ranks Dubai first in the Middle East and 18th globally. Within the Index, Dubai is among the Top 10 in digital finance.

Since its formation, VARA has been busy forging an enabling ecosystem and identifying a highly selective list of global participants from among the hundreds of industry players it attracts. It is enabled by partnerships with some of the world's most recognised players like Chainalysis, Elliptic, AnChain and Coinfirm. Financial services company Fintonia Group, crypto trading app OKX, and digital brokerage GCEX recently announced their Dubai launches after receiving provisional virtual assets licences from VARA.

OKX, for one, has joined its global peer exchanges to move its regional headquarters to Dubai. At the same time, Fintonia expects to expand its team in Dubai and provide tailored Treasury and Balance Sheet management services to Token Foundations, protocols, Bitcoin miners and other large holders of digital assets, the company said.

Piecing together the regulatory jigsaw With VARA and VAL, Dubai is now at the forefront of the virtual assets industry and continues to play a critical role in its growth, evolution, and regulatory future.

Part of the policy and regulatory jigsaw, the Dubai Metaverse Strategy and the Dubai Blockchain Strategy aim to position Dubai as a global centre for evolving technologies. The Dubai Blockchain Strategy is one of the many initiatives with 24 blockchain use cases currently implemented across eight key industry sectors, including finance, education, and real estate.

The industry has witnessed a surge in institutional and individual capital. Within digital assets, the crypto market is growing particularly fast. Total transaction volume grew to $15.8 trillion in 2021, up 567 percent from 2020's totals, according to Chainalysis. Research firm Technavio expects the global NFT market size to grow by $147.24 billion between 2021 and 2026 at a CAGR of 35.27 percent.

With several of Web3's leaders and promising start-ups moving to Dubai, the city is also attracting the brightest global talent in this field.

Dubai's virtual assets ecosystem The emirate is home to three free zones dedicated to the Web3 and crypto ecosystem: Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC), Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), and the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre's DMCC Crypto Centre.

Ahmed bin Sulayem, Executive Chairman and CEO of DMCC, said, ""Digital assets are playing an increasingly important role in DMCC's mandate to drive trade through Dubai. Now home to over 400 of the UAE's crypto firms - more than one-third - the DMCC Crypto Centre offers a comprehensive ecosystem to facilitate the development and adoption of cryptographic and blockchain technologies.""

As a relatively new free zone established in 2015, DWTCA's regulatory and competitive operating environment is geared to facilitate the growth of the virtual assets' ecosystem in Dubai. VARA, responsible for licensing and regulating the virtual assets sector across Dubai's mainland and free zone territories (excluding DIFC), is linked to the DWTC Authority, which aims to become a dedicated zone for regulated virtual assets businesses.

The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the regulatory body of the DIFC free zone, oversees the regulation of investment tokens but does not regulate any other types of crypto assets, including cryptocurrencies, virtual assets, or digital assets.

Hub for high-potential, future-focused firms Dubai's location as an innovation hub bridging the East and the West helps it offer unrivalled access to the world's fastest-growing economies. A traditional global financial hub, Dubai is well equipped as a safe and highly well-regulated conduit for trillions of dollars' worth of transactions between the East and the West.

Dubai is now also home to major industry events like ETHDubai and Binance Blockchain Week, which saw hundreds of international Web3 entrepreneurs, experts, and enthusiasts participate in fireside chats and panel discussions in March this year.

To be held at the Museum of the Future in September this year, the Dubai Metaverse Assembly will bring together regional and international experts in Dubai. More than 300 global experts, policymakers, thought leaders, and decision-makers from more than 40 organisations will explore how the revolutionary metaverse technology can be deployed across vital sectors to create a better future and quality of life for humanity.

With Dubai now home to a large community of innovative start-ups shaping the future of finance, it has embarked upon a new mission to conquer the new economic frontier.

Senior executives from major corporations as well as leaders and experts in metaverse technologies discussed topics such as the relationship between the metaverse and gaming, retail, banking, and venture capital.

Seven side sessions took place on the sidelines of the second day of the Dubai Metaverse Assembly, which convened more than 600 delegates at the Museum of the Future and Area 2071, Emirates Towers, to lead discussions on the metaverse.

Taking place in the Dubai Future Accelerators, Everdome presented a workshop on 'Creating Worlds and Experiences for a Hyper-Realistic Metaverse', which included an interplanetary journey to Mars.

Participants were taken on an immersive space journey to a detailed metaverse city on the red planet. They explored the potential of a pioneering metaverse adventure with both social and business elements, and learned about the 'BIG' metaverse adoption hypotheses, as well as the creative process of world-building.

MasterCard hosted a workshop titled 'How Shopping, Banking, and Gaming are Spearheading the Metaverse' - while another workshop by Verse Estate at Coders HQ titled 'The Metaverse: Not Just a Game but a Game Changer,' examined how the metaverse is increasingly impacting sectors and spheres outside of gaming.

Meanwhile, a session titled 'Venture Capital for the Metaverse', led by the UAE's Crypto Oasis at Coders HQ, explored investment opportunities in virtual worlds.

Crypto Oasis hosted another side session at Coders HQ titled 'Web2: Silicon Valley, Web 3: Crypto Oasis'.

MetaDecrypt led a workshop at Government Accelerators called 'A Day of Immersive Learning Experience in the Metaverse', which exposed participants to the potential the metaverse has to transform training and education. Another workshop titled 'Metaverse and Web3 Discussions' was also organised by MetaCon.

The inaugural Dubai Metaverse Assembly took place on September 28 and 29, 2022, and witnessed more than 25 main and side sessions led by tech experts and specialists in the metaverse. AI systems also worked together on tangible outcomes that contribute to the future of the metaverse.

67;;"Dubai: The final day of the inaugural Dubai Metaverse Assembly on Thursday focused on innovation, data privacy, security and public trust as the foundation and core elements of building the metaverse.

Speakers and experts who gathered at Dubai Museum of the Future also talked about investments, regulations and policies that will enable a productive environment for metaverse to thrive.

At a panel discussion titled 'The Role of Governments in Virtual Worlds', Christian Kunz from Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) Authority, said: ""From a regulator point of view, ours is a risk-based approach but we also ensure that the technology will not be misused. There must be consumer and company protection as well as financial accountability and fairness.""

As part of Web3.0 (the so-called next iteration of the internet), metaverse is an emerging virtual space where users -- represented by their avatars -- congregate to work, meet, game, or socialise in 3D virtual spaces.

Kunz noted there are many challenges in the fast-evolving metaverse but opportunities also abound, as the digital world is estimated to grow by as much as $3 trillion in 10 years. He noted understanding the risks -- particularly in terms of data security and safety -- and building the opportunities should be given equal treatment. Meaning, one should not take precedent over the other.

One of the challenges in the nascent virtual world Kunz noted is the implementation and nature of laws that differ from one country to the other. Metaverse poses a big problem on jurisdiction given that it is borderless.

To solve this, Kunz noted, a cultural shift is need, where individuals and not just companies take responsibility in the digital world. There should also be a lot of time and resources to be spent to educate people in the cultural shift and all players in the metaverse ecosystem should come together ""to bring a piece of solution to the puzzle.""

Customers as gatekeepers

Another speaker at the event, Keith Jordan from Mastercard, noted customers and corporations should act as the gatekeepers on metaverse.

""Customers should be at the centre of the decentralised operation,"" he noted, adding: ""The speed of the development of metaverse is astounding, affecting every vertical industry, and the dynamic power shift (should be placed) in the hands of consumers.""

Jordan, meanwhile, praised the UAE for talking proactive steps in promoting and advancing metaverse and its related technology in the government and society. Dubai Metaverse Strategy was unveiled in July this year, aiming to create 40,000 jobs and adding $4 billion to Dubai's economy in the next five years. Prior to that, in May, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) was established to regulator digital assets in Dubai.

Need to pivot

While the metaverse is still at its nascent stage, industry leaders are advised to become early adopters.

Jérémy Denisty, managing partner at Dubai-based management consultancy Scopernia, said: ""To start planning for such a future, businesses will need to pivot from the two-dimensional transactional nature of Web2.0 and welcome three-dimensionally integrated hardware tools, cloud-based infrastructure, as well as a forward-facing connected workforce.""

He added organisations need to learn how to leverage the third iteration of the internet, ""which is based on decentralised, permissionless, and transparent blockchain-based technologies alongside digital identity ownership, that form the foundation of the metaverse, NFTs, and cryptocurrencies.""

Diplomacy Lab NFT

Meanwhile, The Diplomacy Lab, an initiative launched by Fatima Bint Mohamed Bin Zayed Initiative in collaboration with Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy, has launched an NFT (non-fungible token) membership to individuals in becoming a core part of its community.

The Diplomacy Lab defines its core value with themes related to culture, space, innovation, tolerance, youth, women empowerment, technology, climate action and heritage. The purchase of the NFT will include certain benefits such as access to the its events, programmes and exclusive networking.

HoloLens 2 makes a debut

Microsoft has debuted its latest iteration augmented reality headset HoloLens 2 on the final day of Dubai Metaverse Assembly. Tariq Hijazi, director of public sector at Microsoft UAE, said: ""The UAE has always been at the forefront of adopting, refining and increasingly exporting new, cutting-edge technologies. The metaverse is no different, and as always through our more than 30-year history, we stand ready to support the country in realising its vision. We have been working hard to enable the bridge between the physical and digital worlds -- from investing in IoT and digital twin solutions at scale, to broad AI deployments, the future of meetings with Teams and our work with Mesh and HoloLens in mixed reality.""";{'uri': 'gulfnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'GULF NEWS'}
68;;"Crypto Oasis will discuss the potential of the exhilarating virtual environment with the global metaverse community

Crypto Oasis will be hosting three sessions at the Dubai Metaverse Assembly, that is taking place on September 28-29, 2022 at The Museum of the Future.

The Dubai Metaverse Assembly is slated to bring together regional and international experts in Dubai to shape the future of the metaverse.

The first session with Meta Decrypt will be a discussion titled: Design Thinking - Digital Economy in the Metaverse. This will be an enriching and engaging talk about creating a more participatory economy and also discuss a broad range of metaverse use cases from strategy through execution. Especially as it is expected that a fully realised metaverse won't just be a part of the digital economy but it will be its own quasi-independent economy, that may end up reweaving the fabric of the digital world.

The second session will be a panel discussion on Venture Capital in the metaverse. The participants will be as follows:

* Valerie Hawley - True Global Ventures

* Jawad Ashraf - Virtua

* Domenik Maier - iBloxx

* Saqr Ereiqat - Crypto Oasis

The metaverse is a venture capitalist's dream. The metaverse represents a real opportunity for innovation and significant startup returns. VCs around the world acknowledge that it has the potential to be a multi-trillion dollar market. With advances made in bandwidth, chips, software, and new (hardware) platforms, metaverse adoption is expected to rise, which is why there is an abundance of capital in this space.

The final session will be a thought leadership talk by Crypto Oasis co-founder Saqr Ereiqat titled: Web2 is Silicon Valley, Web3 is Crypto Oasis. Speaking about the event and the Crypto Oasis sessions, Ereiqat said: ""The Dubai Metaverse Assembly is another step towards the United Arab Emirates being the leading digital economy. The 'Digital Economy Strategy' aims to double the contribution of the digital economy to the UAE's gross domestic product (GDP) from 9.7 per cent as of April 2022 to 20 percent by 2031. It also seeks to enhance the position of the UAE as a hub for the digital economy in the region and globally as we are already witnessing and supporting an influx of intellectual resources into the UAE.

""We believe an ecosystem consists of Talent, Capital, and Infrastructure, with the UAE bringing those 3 together, we have therefore coined the MENA region as Crypto Oasis. At the Dubai Metaverse Assembly, we are proudly hosting 3 sessions to Educate, Inspire, and Contribute. Today the Crypto Oasis, with the UAE at the heart of it, is pushing the frontier in the Web3 space. While Web 2 was primarily based out of Silicon Valley, events like the Dubai Metaverse Assembly and others will ensure that Web 3 is the Crypto Oasis.""

The metaverse assembly will cement Dubai's position as the world's metaverse capital as it looks to leverage Dubai's digital infrastructure and support global transformations and disruptions. The flagship event will explore the digital economy and identify opportunities to help startups, entrepreneurs, communities, investors, and governments unlock the unlimited potential of the metaverse to create a bolder future. The Crypto Oasis is delighted to be part of this first of its kind event that will see the world's leading metaverse experts converge in Dubai.

71;;"Stolen masterpieces are no longer lost - at least not digitally, anyway. A metaverse gallery has opened its doors to art lovers. And, it is solely for the purpose of displaying masterpieces that were stolen, and never found again.

These works have been missing for decades and have some wild stories attached to them.

The company behind the gallery, Compass UOL said, ""The Stolen Art Gallery is the first metaverse museum that displays major works of art that have been stolen or are missing. Visitors, art lovers, and critics can interact with masterpieces that disappeared decades ago in this immersive social experience hall.""

The gallery includes Caravaggio's Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence. On a stormy night, it was stolen from an oratory in Sicily, Italy in 1969. It is probably one of the most famous missing paintings in the world. It was completed in 1609 by the Italian painter.

Caravaggio was known for painting dramatic scenes, which often depicted violent struggles, torture, and people dying. He worked fast with live models, forgoing initial drawings, and working directly onto canvas.

This particular stolen work shows the biblical birth of Jesus, with saints Francis of Assisi and Lawrence surrounding Mary and the newborn. The painting is large - 2.7 meters high by two meters wide.

Two thieves stole the painting by cutting the masterpiece from its frame. They then pinched a carpet and used it to roll up the painting.

Some officials say the robbery was carried out by amateurs. The thieves supposedly saw a TV show about artifacts in Italy a few weeks before. Amazed at its value, they worked out that the building where it was displayed was only guarded by an elderly janitor.

After the robbers stole it, it is thought that the Mafia learned of the theft, probably through the efforts of the thieves trying to sell it. The Mafia made the sale their business and intercepted the painting.

The theft is probably the most significant art crime in the history of the art world. The FBI have declared it to be in their ""Top Ten Art Crimes.""

Interpol, the Italian police, and the FBI have all tried to find the painting. In legitimate markets, it is thought to be worth around $20m. However, black market resale value is known to be less, sometimes only 10% of the legit market price.

Investigators say that in the decades after the theft, the painting changed hands among the Sicilian Mafia. Known as Cosa Nostra by its members, this criminal society of Sicily is thought to still possess the painting.

There have been many informants from the mafia who have claimed to know where it was. One said it was being used as a floor mat by boss Salvatore Riina. A different informant said Riina often showed it off at meetings.

In 2005, a member of the Cosa Nostra, Francesco Marino Mannoia told police that he was involved in the theft. He said that the painting was stolen on commission. When the private buyer saw how damaged the painting was after the theft, he wept and refused to pay. Mannoia stopped short at giving to give the current location of the artwork.

In other accounts, the artwork was moved from boss to boss. One purported boss was Gerlando Alberti. But, he was arrested in 1981, so he was said to have quickly buried the painting with cash and drugs. When his nephew showed police the burial spot, no painting was found.

Another mafia figure, Filippo Graviano, said the painting was destroyed in the 1980s, after being given to the Pullara family in Palermo. They hid it in a barn, however, they came back to find it had been eaten by rats and pigs.

Other accounts say that it was handed on to a Swiss black market dealer, who has since died. Its whereabouts might forever be unsolved.

A replica of the painting was commissioned in 2015 by the Sky television network, who did a documentary about the painting, its theft and its replica. The new painting was recreated using slides and photographs of the original artwork during its last restoration in 1951.

The replica now hangs over the altar where the masterpiece once was for hundreds of years.

Christ in the Storm on the Sea of Galilee is Rembrandt's only seascape. It also ""hangs"" in the metaverse gallery. Burglars nabbed it from the Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990. As far as modern history goes, this robbery was the biggest art heist ever.

Once in the metaverse and looking at this painting, enthusiasts can tap their wrist. Compass UOL says, ""As moonlight filters from a skylight into the darkened warehouse of the gallery and you hear the crashing storm at sea, you can tap your wrist to have a miniature bust of Rembrandt materialize."" Rembrandt says that he ""included a self-portrait in the boat, the only sailor looking back at you from the painting.""

If you visit the metaverse gallery, you will also see Cézanne's View of Auvers-sur-Oise.

This work was pinched out of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, UK. This happened in the early hours before the sunrise of New Year's Day, 1999. It was a meticulously planned raid.

Other works by Van Gogh and Manet also appear in the stolen gallery.

It is this kind of metaverse experience that market research firm Gartner says backs up their research. They claim that 25 percent of people ""will spend at least an hour a day in the metaverse by 2026.""

Compass UOL say they have a few added extras. ""You can come much closer to the painting that you would in a physical museum and notice tiny Rembrandt giving you a half smile as he grabs on to a boat amid the giant waves.""

Alexis Rockenbach is the CEO of Compass UOL. ""It is more about immersive social interaction than just the virtual reality environment. You can interact with your friends around the art pieces, discuss your impressions, make sketches, and share notes and information about the artist, the paintings, and their stories.""";{'uri': 'beincrypto.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'BeInCrypto'}

By Kwon Mee-yoo

The Embassy of Israel in Korea opened in the metaverse, becoming the first diplomatic mission in the country to gain a presence in the virtual world.

On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Korea and Israel, the Israeli Embassy opened a pavilion in the metaverse to offer information about Israel and promote exchanges between the two countries.

""The Israel-Korea Metaverse is a truly unique platform for sharing a virtual reality immersive experience, the history of Israel-Korea relations and also for carrying out all kinds of interesting interactions between Israelis and Koreans. Even though they are 8,000 kilometers apart, yet in the metaverse, they are right next to each other,"" Israeli ambassador to Korea Akiva Tor said during a launching event at a hotel in Seoul, Sept. 20.

According to the embassy, there is no other embassy metaverse with this level of functionality existing anywhere in the world at this time. The embassy developed this with a Korean company called Vrillar.

""I'm quite sure that this is the way forward. It won't be the only tool of public diplomacy and, of course, we will always want to bring real people to Korea and to hold in-person conferences and in-person cultural performances. But I think the embassy metaverse will become the essential standard just as websites became the essential standard about 20 years ago and SNS channels are now,"" the ambassador said.

""The more I think about the potentialities of this breakthrough platform and how it can grow, the more exciting it seems... We'll create new avenues of interaction for people at far distances, like Israelis and Koreans at the opposite ends of Asia.""

The pavilion's exterior is inspired by the Shrine of the Book in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Upon entering the pavilion, the German-born Jewish theoretical physicist, Albert Einstein, welcomes visitors and gives a brief introduction of the pavilion. Einstein is voiced by Michael Reiffenstuel, the German ambassador to Korea.

On the first floor is a gallery introducing the 60-year history of Korea-Israel relations with an olive tree in the center, bringing Israel's national tree to the virtual world.

The virtual space is open for various events and activities, including the MC2 lounge on the second floor, and the ambassador hopes more people will visit and use the pavilion.

""Our challenge as an embassy will be to make this innovative functionality popular in Korea and in Israel, for the people young at heart and open to a new experience of engagement,"" Tor said.

""I'm thinking of a metaverse with Hebrew and Korean language clubs, an Israel Film Festival, virtual meetings of the student clubs of Israel and Korea, a hangout for lovers of K-pop and the Hebrew Bible, a place for talk and debate about archaeology and the future of autonomous vehicles.""

The embassy plans to continuously update the Israel-Korea Metaverse.

74;;"Virtual tourism got a big boost during the pandemic, with VR trips around cities and museums becoming increasingly popular, but will this trend continue?

Researchers think virtual travel will remain, but only ‘where it makes sense’, allowing previews of places and as a substitute for those unable to take trips

From your sofa, climb Mount Everest, visit a museum in New York or dive through a coral reef: virtual experiences have received an enormous boost from the pandemic.

This has not gone unnoticed by the travel and leisure industry. No longer is the technology being used just for their marketing, but also as a product. Is the hype here to stay? And if so, where is the journey heading?

Two experts – Armin Brysch, who researches this topic at Kempten University of Applied Sciences, and Tristan Horx, who studies new trends at the Zukunftsinstitut (future institute) in Frankfurt, Germany – share their thoughts about the future of virtual reality travel.

If you look at virtual travel, it quickly becomes clear that the industry is only just trying its hand at it. For example, the Tourism Authority of Madrid has begun offering a virtual experience to see the Spanish capital before an actual trip.

A visitor needs to book a 30-minute appointment on the authority’s website, with the tour using a video phone call via Zoom. Once connected, a tour guide virtually surfs through the streets of Madrid, stopping at places when the visitor has questions.

Soon, 360-degree images appear with the tour guide zooming in, for example, at the Royal Palace. The service provides a useful first impression of a city, but it really doesn’t amount to a complete virtual reality (VR) experience.

VR travel requires a “computer-generated, virtual, three-dimensional environment that you perceive with VR glasses”, explains Brysch.

Shielding all outside light by means of the VR glasses – in what is called a “cave”, or a room fully equipped with monitors – is necessary for the viewer to be completely surrounded by the virtual world.

“The deeper the traveller is immersed in the world provided them, the more realistic the artificial experience is,” says Brysch. Experts call this immersion, and it requires high-resolution images and an exciting narrative.

Even if some tourism experts still call virtual reality travel a niche development, there is no doubt that something is afoot.

With German company Timeride, for example, you can go on a virtual journey through cities at different points in history, and immerse yourself in the life of earlier eras.

Does all this have a future? According to a recent survey by market researcher Bitkom Research, it would appear so.

The next big thing is the “metaverse” – the virtual space that expands on today’s internet and in which one moves and interacts as a digital model of oneself.

The Bitkom survey found that 21 per cent of respondents aged 16 and over expect to explore foreign places with the help of VR goggles in 2030 instead of travelling there in the traditional way.

The proportion is higher among younger people, but even among the over-64 age group, 15 per cent share this view.

“[VR] will remain where it makes sense … By looking at four places with VR glasses and then deciding on one, that can work,” Horx says about choosing a travel destination. His remark should please the tourism experts in Madrid.

The question remains whether virtual travel will replace real travel. Brysch is sure it won’t: “Just because we can look at the destination in 3D, we won’t give up going there.”

For some target groups, however, there could be trade-offs, he says. For example, those people who cannot travel because of physical limitations, or for people who find travel too expensive, stressful, dangerous or harmful to the climate.

“VR can create a substitute experience,” Brysch says.";{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}

A replicated digital twin of the world's tallest building - Burj Khalifa - can now be seen in the metaverse. Cloud-based event management platform Eventcombo, the brain behind the innovation, claims that this experience is accessible with a regular device and a keyboard. This means that the users will not require headsets, gloves or any other VR hardware to watch the iconic skyscraper in the digital world.

During their visit to the Burj Khalifa in the metaverse, individuals will be able to witness a 360-degree view of Dubai and roam around the building. As observed in the demonstration video, virtual avatars are seen walking around the different areas of the building, taking the elevators, walking around the corridors before entering the viewing deck, and offering replicated views of the city.

""While pandemic forced the world into isolation, it also led to advancement and accelerated adoption of the metaverse. Although digital has become the new normal, metaverse is facilitating physical and real-world interactions in digital spaces, to elevate experiences and bridge the real and virtual worlds,"" said Eventcombo.

76;;"Does a Multiverse exist in parallel in a different dimension? What is Metaverse? What does the Museum of the Future Reveal?

People often wonder if there is an alternate universe in existence in another dimension because even scientists are often baffled at the thought of such a universe in a different time zone.

Even the best scientists have yet to fully discover all the secrets of the universe that houses all the planets, stars, and constellations, so it won't be prudent for them to know much about a parallel universe that no one knows about.

Nowadays, people are interested in learning about the Metaverse, which is a new concept where the virtual world of internet is facilitated via Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) headsets due to which the wearer is transported into that world despite being his existence being firmly entrenched in the real world.

Speaking of metaverse, the latest buzz doing the rounds is that Dubai's Museum of the Future just recently kicked off the first ever Dubai Metaverse on September 28, 2022, the venue for which was Area 2071, Emirates Towers, Dubai.

This project was envisioned by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who is the Vice President cum Prime Minister cum Ruler of Dubai, in a bid to provide a platform for creativity, innovation, and technology to get a much needed boost within the country so as to bring positive changes in humanity.

The global event's motive is to help governments, companies, tech industry, and international organizations to explore numerous opportunities, capabilities, and many other facets of the metaverse.

There are many international organizations that are into learning about the various Metaverse applications for which the Dubai Metaverse Assembly gave their contribution as it will provide motivation to the governments, and societies for the major transformations that is due to happen in the coming decades and have a huge impact in the lives of people.

Around 300 specialists and experts were hosted at the event along with 40 other local and global organizations and tech companies, all of which participated in the numerous sessions and workshops where nearly 50 international speakers added their two cents to the project.

The international organizations participating in the event were masters in their fields- World Economic Forum, MasterCard, Binance, META, Bedu, The Sandbox, Accenture, among many others, all of whom gave valuable inputs to make the Metaverse project successful.

During the first day of the event, it was all about the economic size of the Metaverse and its future, along with numerous opportunities that could be availed in the virtual real estate, augmented/virtual reality and its impact on the real world, among many others, which was quite an illuminating conference for many of the attendants.

The event proved to be a success where discussions took place and opinions were exchanged but the ultimate aim of the event was to bring all the international organizations involved in the study of Metaverse to be on the same page and use its components for the benefit of mankind in general.";{'uri': 'mymobileindia.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'My Mobile'}

Speaking at Dubai Metaverse Assembly, Ali Sajwani said online-only transactions are accounting for an increasing proportion of DAMAC Properties' real-estate activity

Fully interactive virtual real estate and communities designed in the metaverse are driving significant growth in DAMAC Properties' pure online sales, Ali Sajwani, General Manager of Operations at DAMAC Properties and CEO of D-Labs, said while speaking at the Dubai Metaverse Assembly.

Speaking alongside fellow Web3 experts at the event, Sajwani stated that online-only transactions are accounting for an ever-increasing proportion of DAMAC Properties' real-estate activity - approximately $100mn per quarter, at present. He added that the UAE-based developer has set a target of growing this figure to $150mn per month by mid-2023.

In addition to Sajwani, the Dubai Metaverse Assembly's 'Sector Deep-Dive: Opportunities in Virtual Real Estate' panel featured Joe Abi Akl, Chief Corporate Development Officer at Majid Al Futtaim Group, Guy Parsonage, Partner and Leader at PwC Experience Center, and Sam Hamilton, Creative Director at Decentraland Foundation.

At its recent Digital Construction Summit, Big Project Middle East put together several regional experts to discuss what the metaverse means for the construction sector.

Speaking in front of delegates during the panel discussion, Sajwani said: ""When the global pandemic hit, DAMAC Properties started an online-only channel for sales. We would sell to our customers using Microsoft Teams and Zoom, and these sales are substantial. We now generate over $100mn per quarter using that channel. But as you will appreciate, conversions tend to be low because this is not an immersive experience, so we took the decision to invest in the metaverse, creating digital twins of all our assets and communities to allow our customers to inspect the villas and apartments they wish to purchase virtually.""

The metaverse, also known as Web3, is increasingly being used by real estate developers to host digital twins, virtual facsimiles of real-world structures and communities. In conjunction with virtual reality (VR) technology, these models not only enable investors to view and inspect properties from anywhere on the planet, but they can also be used to supplement owners' physical assets by allowing them to engage with digital environments, DAMAC noted.

Sajwani and his fellow panellists discussed a range of topics related to real estate and Web3, including the burgeoning virtual-only property sector, how the technology is being leveraged to engage prospective investors, and the trends and opportunities we can expect to see as the metaverse develops.

In June 2022, Sajwani explained how the UAE is future-proofing by being a metaverse champion.

Commenting on the importance of leveraging Web3-specific talent and expertise, Sajwani added: ""What's key for organisations that want to move into this space is to set up a separate entity and team. The talent in this space and the skillset; they tend to be younger people who may not be suited to typical corporate cultures. We set up an entity called D-Labs to work on the DAMAC Group metaverse project.""

Launched by DAMAC Properties' parent company DAMAC Group in April 2022, D-Labs forms part of company-wide ambitions to catalyse advancements in digital assets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), establishing the group as a leading global brand in the metaverse.

Those who invest in the developer's digital real estate also gain access to its real-world amenities, including food and beverage (F&B) outlets, hotels, resorts and more, it added.

With up to $100mn of investment earmarked for the venture, D-Labs is working to develop a variety of virtual homes and communities, as well as digital wearables and jewellery from DAMAC-owned brands such as Roberto Cavalli and de GRISOGONO.

The Dubai Metaverse Assembly was hosted by the Dubai Future Foundation at the Museum of the Future from 28-29 September 2022. The global event brought together more than 300 regional and international experts from over 40 industry leaders who are playing an active role in shaping the Web3 landscape and capitalising on its potential applications.

Late in July 2022, Omnix Engineering's Bhaskar Raman said that in the near future, cloud-based digital twins will serve predominantly as an asset management environment. In early September 2022, Virtuzone launched 'The V' tower in the metaverse.

In the parallel universe, NFT marketplace Yunometa launched the Women's Chennai Open in the metaverse on September 10. The event will be live till November 10.

""If someone wanted to watch the Chennai Open but couldn't make it, we've created a virtual stadium and users can pick their avatar and be a part of the tournament from wherever they are instead of depending on, say, a static TV feed. This is the way the metaverse will develop and become the future,"" Arijit Mukherjee, founder and chief executive officer of Yunometa, told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview.

The metaverse is opening possibilities and opportunities for people to experience anything and everything virtually, in the comfort of their own space, says Mukherjee.

The Chennai Open Metaverse also has a tennis court where visitors can choose their avatars and play a match with avatars of their favourite players.

Well-known retired professional tennis player and sports commentator Vijay Amritraj is also a part of the metaverse event.

82;;"Technological advancement is playing a key role in preserving and promoting cultural heritage assets that are at risk of extinction or destruction. Su Zihan reports from Hong Kong.

The ""rebuilt"" Crane's Nest in the metaverse. (PHOTO PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY)

As new infrastructure continues to proliferate Hong Kong amid massive redevelopment, many of the city's old buildings have faded into oblivion.

To name a few, the former Star Ferry Pier at Edinburgh Place; the old General Post Office Building on Pedder Street, Central; Club Germania on Kennedy Road; and the ""Crane's Nest"" -- the Kowloon Tong home of late kung fu icon Bruce Lee -- have all vanished from the scene, although they are a collective memory for Hong Kong people.

It may not be possible to re-create these lost structures in the real world. But today, as technology continues to progress, the option of visiting virtual renditions of real-world locations is becoming viable, allowing such heritage that have been removed from the urban landscape to venture into the digital space.

""What if the historical architectures demolished from the city's landscape get to relive their moments?"" This is a question posed on the website of the (un)lost architecture NFT project.

The ""rebuilt"" Crane's Nest in the metaverse. (PHOTO PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY)

Launched by Charles Lai Chun-wai, who holds a doctorate in architectural history from the University of Hong Kong, the project is to digitally re-create Hong Kong's demolished historical buildings in the metaverse.

The first batch of the (un)lost architecture series consists of five NFT (non-fungible token) projects -- Club Germania, the old Star Ferry Pier at Edinburgh Place, the third-generation General Post Office, the second-generation Queen's Pier, and the old Peak Tower. Buyers can now view those lost places in the virtual world and own architectural models.

Many of these meaningful historical buildings in the special administrative region are known to younger generations through old photographs or videos. However, Lai says, from an architectural point of view, relying on photographs alone doesn't allow one to feel the volume and design of any of the buildings itself, or its three-dimensional aesthetics as a building from different angles.

The ""rebuilt"" Crane's Nest in the metaverse. (PHOTO PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY)

""The project is thus aimed at re-creating lost historical buildings digitally and raising funds for research and the preservation of Hong Kong's old buildings,"" says Lai.

The project was launched in December 2021 at a price of 0.02 ethers (about HK$225, or $28.6) per NFT. It has already achieved its expected sales target, with 80 percent of the NFTs sold so far. The project will enter its second phase, in which augmented-reality features will be added to enable users to ""revisit"" the lost buildings in their locations, according to Lai.

While the current stage of the project is more like an NFT artwork, he hopes to bring a better interactive experience to buyers later, making more people cherish and preserve local historical buildings.

'An unrestricted form'

As technology continues to advance, the option of accessing virtual renditions of real-world locations is becoming more feasible, enabling users to immerse themselves in real-life simulations that are difficult or impossible to visit in real life.

Just walk along To Fuk Road and Rutland Quadrant in Kowloon Tong before turning into Cumberland Road and keep walking until you reach No 41. After opening the dark yellow gate, you will find a cobblestone path that winds through the lawn of the courtyard to a two-story townhouse. The courtyard is flanked by greenery on both sides of the house, alongside which is parked a vintage red Mercedes. This is the original site of Bruce Lee's Crane's Nest, which was demolished in 2019.

The rebuilt heritage preservation project now extends into the virtual world through the metaverse. Visitors are able to step inside again with a VR headset and remote-control handle. People can even own it in the near future as an NFT.

To commemorate the 49th anniversary of the martial arts superstar's death, the Bruce Lee Club has partnered with local digital marketing company Prizm Group to re-create the actor's former home in Kowloon Tong through VR technology, hoping to reclaim memories and cultural preservation by leveraging Web3 and blockchain technology.

Using advanced 3D imaging technologies, three students from the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (Sha Tin), with the assistance of two professors from the School of Design of Hong Kong Polytechnic University and computer graphics artist Shannon Ma Fu-keung, accurately digitalized the site, preserving the building's historical value in its entirety in the metaverse for future generations to visit and have an immersive experience in the virtual mansion and garden.

""It's remarkable to achieve the successful restoration of Lee's home in a virtual world with advanced technology,"" says Bruce Lee Club Chairman Wong Yiu-keung. He hopes that such a virtual preservation project will pass on the superstar's spirit from generation to generation in an unrestricted form.

Bruce Lee spent his final years in the Crane's Nest with his family before his sudden death on July 20, 1973, at the age of 32. The mansion was initially transformed into a hotel, and was once planned to be converted into a memorial hall. The special administrative region government had discussed with the owner the possibility of turning the two-story house into a museum in 2008, but no agreement was reached. Despite a decadelong campaign by fans of the late kung fu legend to preserve the building, it was torn down in September 2019.

""We did a lot of research into the preservation project and, by putting it in the metaverse, we managed to digitalize some hard copies and make them 'live' longer"", says Prizm Director Jeffrey Hau.

""Bruce Lee was an icon, a bridge between East and West, and a role model for millions of people. Preserving his old home in the metaverse is a symbol of reviving the prime time of Hong Kong culture,"" he says.

Hau believes it's a great demonstration of what technology can achieve, making it possible to revive more disappearing buildings, events and attractions in the metaverse, and let young people understand their background, where they came from and cultivate the culture.

He hopes the project will reintroduce Bruce Lee to the younger generation, revive traditional culture, pass on the superstar's spirit, and serve as a showcase for other cultural preservation and branding projects.

Prizm provides mainly digital marketing support for the project via channels such as websites, social media and blockchains.

Creating new stories

The Crane's Nest project will be made fully available across the globe on July 20, 2023 -- the 50th anniversary of Lee's death.

At present, visitors can only make some simple interactions in the virtual Crane's Nest by wearing VR headsets and handles, walking around the garden or searching for hidden postcards with Lee's handwriting.

In the future, the two-story townhouse will be open to the public, featuring Lee's living room, dining room and training room. They will be able to access all the activities, including gamelike interactions and events.

Anthony Kong Pui-keung, assistant professor of the School of Design at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and program leader of the school's Master of Science in Multimedia and Entertainment Technology program, is involved in the virtual reconstruction of Lee's home. He envisages re-creating the mansion in the metaverse in three stages -- reproducing the virtual architectural scene, creating a sensory perception of people in the metaverse, and telling the stories or collective memories created by visitors in the virtual world.

As advances in space capture technologies, such as photogrammetry, 3D modeling and spatial mapping, have given metaverse architecture many photorealistic virtual experiences, Kong believes that new stories and new experiences are the real ultimate key to the conservation of historic buildings and other cultural heritage assets in the metaverse.

For example, if visitors to Lee's home could spar with the actor and re-create the martial arts event in the virtual world, this would give a deeper understanding of Lee's character, and the context in which he had lived, rather than a pale replica of that scene. In such a way, even non-Lee fans would be steep in the scenario and create their own memories through immersive interaction, says Kong.

He likens new stories to the soul of cultural heritage transmission. ""The interactive function in the metaverse gives rise to the possibility of future generations creating their own new stories in it and injecting fresh blood into the continuation of cultural heritage,"" he said.

Digital culture is characterized by playfulness, cinematography, storytelling and surrealism, says Kong. When putting the conservation of ancient architectural heritages into the metaverse, one is inclined to create something new in its original context, rather than a replica of history -- creating new stories in live based on previous historic ones.

""The functionality of the built heritages will degrade with the evolution of the times,"" Kong says. ""To preserve them in the physical or virtual world, it's most important to give them a new function. The story might not be 100 percent equal to facts or realities, but it contains our collective memory.""";{'uri': 'chinadailyasia.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'China Daily Asia'}

He hopes the project will reintroduce Bruce Lee to the younger generation, revive traditional culture, pass on the superstar's spirit, and serve as a showcase for other cultural preservation and branding projects.

Prizm provides mainly digital marketing support for the project via channels such as websites, social media and blockchains.

Creating new stories

The Crane's Nest project will be made fully available across the globe on July 20, 2023 -- the 50th anniversary of Lee's death.

At present, visitors can only make some simple interactions in the virtual Crane's Nest by wearing VR headsets and handles, walking around the garden or searching for hidden postcards with Lee's handwriting.

In the future, the two-story townhouse will be open to the public, featuring Lee's living room, dining room and training room. They will be able to access all the activities, including gamelike interactions and events.

Anthony Kong Pui-keung, assistant professor of the School of Design at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and program leader of the school's Master of Science in Multimedia and Entertainment Technology program, is involved in the virtual reconstruction of Lee's home. He envisages re-creating the mansion in the metaverse in three stages -- reproducing the virtual architectural scene, creating a sensory perception of people in the metaverse, and telling the stories or collective memories created by visitors in the virtual world.

As advances in space capture technologies, such as photogrammetry, 3D modeling and spatial mapping, have given metaverse architecture many photorealistic virtual experiences, Kong believes that new stories and new experiences are the real ultimate key to the conservation of historic buildings and other cultural heritage assets in the metaverse.

For example, if visitors to Lee's home could spar with the actor and re-create the martial arts event in the virtual world, this would give a deeper understanding of Lee's character, and the context in which he had lived, rather than a pale replica of that scene. In such a way, even non-Lee fans would be steep in the scenario and create their own memories through immersive interaction, says Kong.

He likens new stories to the soul of cultural heritage transmission. ""The interactive function in the metaverse gives rise to the possibility of future generations creating their own new stories in it and injecting fresh blood into the continuation of cultural heritage,"" he said.

Digital culture is characterized by playfulness, cinematography, storytelling and surrealism, says Kong. When putting the conservation of ancient architectural heritages into the metaverse, one is inclined to create something new in its original context, rather than a replica of history -- creating new stories in live based on previous historic ones.

""The functionality of the built heritages will degrade with the evolution of the times,"" Kong says. ""To preserve them in the physical or virtual world, it's most important to give them a new function. The story might not be 100 percent equal to facts or realities, but it contains our collective memory.""";{'uri': 'chinadailyhk.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'chinadailyhk'}
84;;"Grandes incumbentes de la industria de telecomunicaciones y actores estratégicos en diferentes líneas tecnológicas colaboraron en una prueba de concepto de realidad virtual (RV) usando tecnología de comunicación 5G. Entre los actores que colaboraron con esta prueba se encuentran: Ericsson, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, AT&T, Wevr, Dreams Immersive (Dreamscape) y Warner.

En la nota sobre el test que realizaron Entel y Ericsson en la Escuela Domingo Santa María de cómo hacer una clase mediante realidad virtual, en ella comentamos dos de las grandes aristas de estos procesos:

El primer punto tiene un parangón cercano, y probablemente conocido para algunos, los que usan plataformas de juegos en línea (cloud gaming) como GeForce Now de NVIDIA, saben que pueden ver todos sus juegos en cualquier monitor o TV con conexión a internet. Esto NO requiere dispositivos para procesar las gráficas de manera local, ya que los servidores de NVIDIA lo hacen por ti.

La siguiente figura muestras las tres típicas realidades de los jugadores hoy en día. La primera es la más típica y antigua, en que tiene todos los juegos físicos y/o disponibles en tu computador; la segunda es la que hoy ofrece Steam, con la compra de licencia digital y descargar en el PC; y finalmente el servicio que hoy tiene GeForce Now, juegos que están disponibles y optimizados en prácticamente cualquier plataforma.

El siguiente esquema muestra cómo funciona el cloud gaming en todo el proceso, desde que entregas una instrucción con el mando de juegos, hasta que se refleja en la pantalla el desplazamiento o movimiento. En cada nodo de conexión se observará un retraso propio de la gestión de la información.

El procesado gráfico de los juegos en línea (cloud gaming), se deriva de un concepto más genérico como el cloud computing. Es decir, de manera remota los servidores realizan todos los cálculos y procedimientos en milisegundos, para luego enviar la información procesada directamente a nuestros dispositivos. La computación en la nube, en sí, se basa en que toda la fuerza de cálculo es ejecutada por un tercero, para que tú no debas tener equipos caros y dedicados para el procesamiento de datos.

Los costos asociados a este tipo de servicio es la propia suscripción mensual a la plataforma, y por supuesto, la latencia que se experimenta por la lejanía y demanda de recursos del servidor. La lejanía de los servidores genera una alta latencia en el tiempo de respuesta entre el mando, y la respuesta del juego en tu pantalla.

Esta fue una de las razones por la cual GeForce no abrió su plataforma en Latam hasta disponer de una infraestructura adecuada para sortear estos problemas. El proceso de acercar los servidores a la zona donde quieres prestar el servicio, técnicamente, se conoce como edge computing, que es un derivado del cloud computing.

De hecho, hasta hace algunos meses, aún había colas o filas de espera para poder acreditarse en la plataforma de NVIDIA, que de manera local es administrada por ABYA.

Por tanto, volviendo a la idea central de la nota, si una gráfica normal requiere bastante poder de cálculo, lo necesario para resolver la realidad virtual, será mucho más grande.

Una vez resuelto el problema de la potencia de cálculo, es necesario sortear los canales de comunicación para poder procesar estas grandes cantidades de información. Para esto ya sabes que la fibra óptica será nuestro principal aliado, sin embargo, los despliegues de fibra óptica requieren su tiempo. En segundo lugar, la tecnología de comunicación inalámbrica de quinta generación (5G), cuando esté completamente desplegada, ayudará a cubrir las zonas en las que no llega la fibra óptica por temas logísticos o geográficos.

Una red de alta velocidad resuelve, en gran parte, el tiempo de respuesta entre un punto y otro (latencia), permitiendo que las interacciones sean casi instantáneas.

No obstante, tenemos una limitante, por mucha fibra óptica que dispongamos, la luz tiene un límite físico respecto de su velocidad (299.792 km/s en el vacío), con mayor razón si viaja por un medio.

Si a esta ecuación agregamos los diferentes nodos por los que debe pasar y resolver los paquetes datos, nos encontramos que esto limita aún más el tiempo de respuesta. Esta particularidad es propia de la fibra óptica y el 5G.

Tal como lo planteamos en el título anterior, la única manera de salvar este problema es crear centros de cómputos (o servidores) cercanos a la zona donde se busca prestar el servicio (ABYA con NVIDIA), o bien el propio centro de datos de Google ubicado en Chile.

Si analizamos un poco más el punto anterior, también nos podremos dar cuenta que por mucho que el procesamiento de datos se acerque de manera geográfica, puede que la demanda y la cercanía no sean suficientes para lograr una experiencia completamente inmersiva y con el tiempo de respuesta requerido para los juegos o la realidad virtual (RV).

Desde aquí se gesta una idea de estos mini centros de datos ubicados en locales o bodegas, que acercarían el procesamiento y ayudarían a descongestionar el servidor primario. En este punto, hay una idea de negocio futuro, muy interesante, que puede ser una alternativa para alguien que tiene un apropiado para una instalación de este tipo.

Sin embargo, hay condiciones como el costo eléctrico mensual, climatización, empalme eléctrico especial, podrían ser impedimentos para levantar esta nueva idea de negocios de procesamiento de datos local, para juegos, realidad virtual, o alguna otra futura modalidad.

La siguiente figura plantea una modalidad de mini o microcentros de datos ubicados en la radio bases donde operan las antenas. Además, muestra esquemáticamente la diferencia entre la operación del 4G y el 5G.

Hace referencia a un concepto que engloba todo el espacio virtual que está más allá del espacio descrito por los fenómenos físicos.

En términos generales, abarca:

Es decir, son todas las versiones posibles de esta tecnología que nos permite cambiar ""nuestra experiencia de lo que consideramos real"".

El estudio presentado por Ericsson titulado: ""El futuro del entretenimiento con 5G, un enfoque cooperativo para experiencias de realidad virtual inmersiva usando tecnología 5G"". Desglosa el análisis planteando los retos de cómputo de la realidad extendida, plantea una solución al problema y cierra con los resultados.

Ericsson plantea que, en encuestas de hace algunos años, muchos usuarios se visualizaban utilizando lente de realidad aumentada para el 2025. En otro estudio, se confirma que el 55% de los encuestados les gustaría visitar museos de otros países, simulando como si estuvieras allí.

Por otra parte, en otro estudio de ADL y Ericsson, desarrollado en 2019, se detectó que el potencial de negocios entre empresas (B2B) empleando tecnología de realidad virtual (RV), sería alrededor de, 12.000 millones de dólares para el año 2026. Las posibles áreas beneficiadas: sanitario, manufactura y público.

Tal como ya hemos descrito más arriba y en otras notas, una de las dificultades de la RV es la potencia de cómputo necesaria para su correcta y fluida operatividad.

Por otra parte, usar gafas de realidad virtual (RV) como los HTC Vive, recordarás que era todo un problema de logística, tras el casco ibas con un montón de cables, que actúan como un cordón umbilical conectado a un PC que realizaba todas las operaciones de cálculo. Aquí se presenta un segundo problema, la movilidad.

Una de las primeras soluciones que se le dio al problema de los cables y a la dependencia del computador, es la creación de un casco con el hardware necesario para poder procesar directamente la información; sin embargo, el espacio dentro del conjunto es la mayor limitante.

Un segundo enfoque, es el uso de una típica mochila en la que se instala todo el hardware necesario para procesar la información de la realidad virtual. Pero, en este caso, el problema radica en que el bolso pesa, en promedio, unos 4kg, se puede calentar, el hardware de procesamiento no tiene la ventilación adecuada y se suma una baja duración de batería. Al final termina desencadenando la misma problemática de falta de movilidad.

Por lo anterior, la opción de disponer del hardware cercano en el PC y unas gafas WiFi con altas velocidades se presenta como una opción muy tentadora, ideal para situaciones en el hogar; sin embargo, tal como lo plantea Ericsson:

El enfoque inalámbrico mediante WiFi es una de las más comunes. Sin embargo, una de las principales limitaciones, en un entorno multiusuarios, es que, al ser una banda del espectro sin licencia, es propensa a sufrir interferencias.

Con todas las situaciones expuestas, se explotó una oportunidad de sondear la experiencia multiusuario usando redes 5G y edge computing. La idea consistía en crear una experiencia inmersiva en el mundo de Harry Potter, llamada Chaos of Hogwarts.

En el desarrollo del concepto de Chaos of Hogwarts hay dos equipos diferentes. El primero de ellos son los desarrolladores del entorno gráfico de este mundo de Harry Potter, compuesto por Wevr y Dreamscape Immersive. Ellos ya habían desarrollado la idea de la realidad virtual (RV), utilizando mochilas y cables.

Dreamscape es el encargado de proporcionar los dispositivos hápticos ubicados en manos y la frente. Estos sensores son los encargados de medir la fuerza con la que actúa la persona que estará tras los lentes de RV, es decir, son los que permiten medir el tacto para traducirlo al mundo digital.

Luego, tenemos el segundo equipo, que es el encargado del despliegue de la tecnología tras el concepto:

La idea del concepto es cambiar las mochilas y cables de los usuarios, de modo que la inmersión de la realidad virtual se sienta más real, sin cables molestando y un peso extra en la espalda con la mochila, usando redes 5G como medio de comunicación.

Para los que han probado las redes 5G actuales, sabemos que cumplen en la medida que pueden, y otras redes aún están al debe. Con las redes actuales de 5G NSA (Non stand alone), no sería suficiente la velocidad y ancho de banda para mover todos los datos que requiere la realidad virtual (RV) en alta resolución. En esta dinámica la única opción viable es usar 5G sobre las bandas milimétricas (mmWave):

... en términos sencillos, es un espectro que agrupa las frecuencias entre los 24 y 100 GHz (otros indican 300 GHz), pudiendo otorgar velocidades superiores a los 10 Gbps, a diferencia de su espectro antecesor Sub-6GHz que solo nos otorga velocidades entre 300 Mbps y 1 Gbps.

El gigante de telecomunicaciones de Estados Unidos tiene tres modos diferentes por las que unen a la gente mediante el 5G. En cada modo hace referencia a diferentes bandas de uso, banda baja, media y alta. La primera se conoce como AT&T 5G que une a 277 millones de personas y está presente en 18.000 ciudades de USA. Por otra parte, también existe AT&T 5G+ que se divide en el empleo de las bandas medias como la banda C (4 a 8GHz); y la banda milimétrica, que es la que permite altas velocidades y gran ancho de banda, esta última se encuentra disponible de manera local en 40 ciudades y 40 estadios y centros recreativos.

Para trabajar en redes 5G en banda milimétricas, AT&T y Ericsson se unieron para proporcionar la infraestructura de comunicación. AT&T permitió el acceso a las bandas de milimétricas dentro de su red de 5G+ y Ericsson proporcionó la infraestructura de comunicación privada de 5G. El equipamiento de red fue optimizado por el equipo de Ericsson ubicado en Santa Clara, California, conocido como D-15.

Supongo que estarán pensando, mejor un cable de red y fibra óptica y se acabó el problema, claramente esta es la situación ideal, pero no siempre es factible llegar con el cable de red y la fibra óptica a todos. Es por esto que este concepto es extremo en cuanto a las capacidades del 5G.

¿Por qué es necesario el trabajo conjunto de Ericsson y AT&T?

Ya conocemos cómo se ha enviar la información, ahora ¿cómo la procesamos?

Tal como hemos descrito más arriba, todo el músculo de procesamiento de gráfico es necesario hacerlo en algún sitio. Obviamente, podríamos disponer de estaciones locales con el hardware necesario para resolver el trabajo con las gráficas. Sin embargo, habrá situaciones en que estar cambiando constantemente el hardware y depender de técnicos especializados para su mantenimiento, puede volverse de una tarea cualquiera a una carga innecesaria para una empresa.

Ante esta situación, NVIDIA mediante su proyecto Aurora entrega de manera remota una plataforma de software y hardware que permite implementar de manera remota soluciones empresariales que requieran de realidad virtual (RV) y sus variantes (XR).

¿Dónde se ha usado?

El Proyecto Aurora consta de Cloud XR y la Estaciones de trabajo virtuales RTX (vWS), que forman parte de la arquitectura encargada de transmitir contenidos de realidad virtual (y sus derivados) mediante cualquier sistema de transmisión de datos (cables de red, WiFi, 5G, fibra óptica, etc.).

En este punto ya sabemos cómo vamos a enviar la información y cómo la vamos a procesar. Pero nos queda otro elemento importante: ¿cómo recogemos los desplazamientos y las sensaciones de las personas que participarán de Chaos of Hogwarts de Harry Potter?

El conjunto típico de realidad virtual está compuesto por el casco que contiene las gafas, encargado de transportarnos al mundo de digital, también incluye los audífonos con tecnología surround para dar sensación de espacio y ambiente; y por último los dispositivos hápticos de manos y cabeza proporcionados por Dreamscape.

La plataforma XR2 de Qualcomm es la primera plataforma encargada de conectar el 5G con la realidad virtual, la que fue lanzada a finales de 2019. Gracias a su tecnología, el chipset del casco permite transmitir directamente la información a la estación de red privada de 5G de Ericsson.

XR2 permite el uso simultáneo de 7 cámaras para una ubicación espacial de precisión, permite una combinación de entornos digitales con reales, y aumenta la inmersión en situación de servicios de realidad mixta (virtual + aumentada). XR2 puede operar con videos de resolución 8K de 360º con una velocidad de renderización de 60fps, y todo se puede transmitir inalámbricamente vía redes 5G. Esta tecnología, hoy en día, se encuentra presente en los Oculus Quest 2 de Meta (Facebook).

Ya tenemos resuelta que tecnología que se ocupa en cada etapa del proceso, pero ahora veamos cómo funciona el conjunto completo.

La experiencia multiusuario de realidad virtual (RV) sobre redes 5G, logro una inmersión más completa sin uso de cables. La ausencia de estos permite que las personas puedan desplazarse con fluidez.

El concepto en sí validó el empleo de la tecnología de realidad virtual de alta resolución mediante redes inalámbricas de 5G en bandas milimétricas, en donde los usuarios solo experimentaban latencias de 35ms. Latencias mayores o cercanas a los 50ms pueden provocar náuseas en los usuarios, debido a la desincronización por el retraso.

Al no tener dispositivos locales para realizar el procesado de los datos de la realidad virtual, esto permite que muchas empresas puedan desarrollar ideas con la realidad virtual (RV), sin la necesidad de invertir en equipos caros, accediendo al servicio en línea.

También permite crear una idea de derivar procesamiento de cálculo hacia servidores, sin necesidad de disponer de equipos potentes de manera local.

De acuerdo con los cálculos presentados, desde el punto de vista de la industria de entretenimiento, se estima que los costos operacionales se reducirían en un 11%, al retirar las mochilas con el equipo de RV, y consecuentemente, aumentará el espacio disponible de operación para más usuarios; además, podrán pasar más horas inmersos, que los tan solo 15 a 20 minutos que permitía la mochila con baterías. Uniendo las dos situaciones se estima que los ingresos aumentarían en un 20%.

El 5G y la realidad extendida (5G XR) serán la puerta de entrada al metaverso, a un nuevo internet que permite mayores interacciones transformando, la manera en que percibimos el mundo digital y/o virtual.

Con las bandas milimétricas del 5G en plena operación, la latencia será imperceptible, permitirá desarrollar el concepto de edge computing en toda su capacidad, facilitando que todas las personas puedan acceder a este mundo virtual, sin necesidad de disponer de hardware de última generación en casa.

Hoy en día nos desplazamos por internet en un formato plano por páginas webs, con diferentes plataformas de video y/o audio. Sin una total integración de un entorno inmersivo, más allá de la manipulación de los elementos mediante el mouse y teclado.

Es por esto que el metaverso permitirá abrir nuevos horizontes a creadores, más contenido y nuevas experiencias. Educadores y profesionales, creando un formato 3D más inmersivo del internet, de modo que los jugadores, las clases y otros puedan interactuar en el entorno en el que estén participando.

El metaverso requiere de la realidad extendida (XR)

La realidad extendida del internet de alta velocidad.

85;;"Partnering with graphic artist Butcher Billy, Atari has created a collection of 2,600 NFTs to celebrate 50 years of innovation.

Atari has gone by many names, having been bought and sold many times, but its legacy has always remained the same. Originally established in 1972, Atari made a mark on the world that nobody expected.

Known as a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers, Atari is the inspiration behind a lot of today's efforts. Atari has brought the likes of Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Mario Bros, and Donkey Kong to old-school console gamers. Having progressed through the space of time, they have continued to bring us games like RollerCoaster Tycoon.

It has been 50 years since their debut, and to celebrate their 50th anniversary, Atari is releasing a collection of GFTs, otherwise known as ""gifting"" NFTs.

To celebrate its 50th anniversary, Atari has partnered with graphic artist Butcher Billy, who previously worked with Stranger Things for season 4, to create a collection of 2,600 NFTs. This collection follows the announcement of their interaction museum-style game highlighting their progress over the last 50 years.

The 2,600 NFTs will also be accompanied by a ""free metaverse experience"", in collaboration with their current web3 and blockchain initiative. In this metaverse, users will have the ability to explore Room 133, a virtual environment where users can find clues relating to the NFT collection.

The NFT/GFT collection was minted on September 20th, 2022. The goal of creating GFTs, or ""gifting"" NFTs, is to inspire users to share their joy with their family, friends, and loved ones. Buyers of these GFTs will only find out whether their NFTs are common, rare, or epic on the day of mint.

Users who buy 4 or more GFTs will be eligible for a 5th surprise GFT. Additionally, GFT holders will be able to compete in game competitions and earn special rewards. Holders are also expected to have access to more features within the Metaverse, although the extent of this sentiment is currently unknown.

The Atari brand is synonymous with video games, and video gaming is the backbone of the metaverse. What better way to commemorate Atari's 50th anniversary than by ushering in a new era of technological innovation while also honoring the brand that launched the modern video game industry?

Atari is also revealing Sunnyvale, within The Sandbox, where you can celebrate the birthplace of Atari and experience their games in the Metaverse. This social and gaming experience features environments based on 17 original Atari games, as well as a game based on Crystal Castles. The Crystal Castles gaming experience will see players racing through a maze castle, collecting gems, and fighting enemies.

As the Metaverse intended, Sunnyvale will allow players to interact and explore within the Metaverse. Users will also be surrounded by Atari-based NPCs, quests, and games. The Atari Sunnyvale will be launching in collaboration with The Sandbox Alpha Season 3, which debuted on the 24th of August 2022.

""The vision that the team at The Sandbox has, and the creativity and energy they bring to the project, makes them an ideal partner for Atari,"" ""We will continue to experiment and find new ways to bring programming to the open world, and look forward to bringing more experiences to players.""

It seems fitting that a company that rose to success because of gaming, is embracing the latest in gaming technology. NFT gaming is streamlining the gaming industry.

Atari has shown interest in blockchain technology long before this, even going as far as creating its own cryptocurrency token. The Atari token is an ERC20 token built with the aim of bettering the interactive entertainment industry.

From creating a digital line of sneakers to their Metaverse casino, Atari wants to revolutionize media and gaming, just as they have done since 1972. This is not the end of Atari as they continue to expand their reach and captivate new audiences with innovative technologies.

The world of gaming has become a better place thanks to blockchain technology, and we can't wait to see what Atari has in store for the future. But for now, happy 50th anniversary Atari.";{'uri': 'bitcoinchaser.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'BitcoinChaser'}
86;;"Como mujer, latina y directora ejecutiva de una organización sin fines de lucro, estoy acostumbrada a estar en salas donde no veo a una sola persona que se parezca a mí. Este es un problema que hay que resolver para las generaciones futuras. A medida que aprendo más sobre la Web 3.0, me pregunto dónde está la comunidad latina en este espacio y por qué las mujeres están poco representadas. Desde conferencias sobre criptomonedas y NFT, hasta eventos centrados en la realidad virtual y el Metaverso, me encontré con que muy pocos proyectos involucraban a las comunidades latinas o a las latinas, más específicamente.

Dado que estas herramientas de la Web 3.0 son bastante novedosas y la mayoría de la gente aún está tratando de entender lo que son, por no hablar de cómo se pueden utilizar para generar ingresos y crear una mejor calidad de vida, el problema de esta división en la tecnología puede no ser evidente. Sin embargo, como vimos con el nacimiento de las computadoras y más tarde de Internet, aprendimos que los que empiezan con retraso suelen tener problemas para ponerse al día con la tecnología y aprovechar sus beneficios más adelante. Según el Centro de Investigación Pew, ""Aproximadamente una cuarta parte de los adultos con ingresos familiares inferiores a 30,000 dólares al año (24%) dice no poseer un teléfono inteligente. Aproximadamente cuatro de cada diez adultos con ingresos inferiores a 30,000 dólares al año no disponen de servicios de banda ancha en casa (43%) ni de computadora de escritorio o portátil (41%)... ""mientras que"" cada una de estas tecnologías es es omnipresente entre los adultos de los hogares que ganan 100,000 dólares o más al año.""

Ya sabemos que desde el punto de vista del consumidor de criptomonedas, las comunidades latinas están interesadas en la criptomoneda. Una encuesta realizada por Morning Consultant descubrió que casi una cuarta parte de los usuarios de criptomonedas en Estados Unidos son latinos. Tal vez sea porque nuestras comunidades han sido dejadas de lado por las instituciones bancarias tradicionales, o por la falta de opciones para el envío de ""remesas"", o el envío de dinero a través de las fronteras. Este interés evidente del lado del consumidor por la criptomoneda demuestra que existe una necesidad real para nuestras comunidades latinas.

Para los jóvenes californianos, la Web 3.0 es el futuro del trabajo, de cómo socializamos, de cómo aprendemos, de cómo hacemos transacciones y de cómo vivimos nuestra vida cotidiana. ¿Por qué entonces no se habla de esto en las escuelas? ¿Por qué el gobierno se toma su tiempo para integrar estas tecnologías en nuestra vida cotidiana en lugar de hacerlas más accesibles para que sean equitativas para todos? En lugar de discutir sólo la regulación de la criptomoneda, deberíamos discutir la integración

La educación es extremadamente importante para mi familia. A los tres años, mi familia y yo emigramos de México a Estados Unidos. Mi familia se mudó a la casa más barata que pudo encontrar en el mejor distrito escolar para darme una buena educación. Vivíamos en una casa de una sola habitación detrás de la granja en la que trabajábamos para llegar a fin de mes.

Enfrentarme a la adversidad a una edad temprana me inspiró a fundar Celebration Nation, una organización sin fines de lucro centrada en ayudar a la comunidad latina y a los trabajadores agrícolas a través de donaciones de alimentos, suministros para el hogar, artículos de primera necesidad para bebés y mucho más. Hemos crecido hasta servir comidas a 10.000 personas cada mes.

Ahora nos embarcamos en nuestro mayor viaje como organización sin fines de lucro: construir nuestro propio metaverso para educar a la juventud latina. Nuestro metaverso incluye un museo y una universidad, en la que planeamos crear un sistema de educación descentralizado para que los estudiantes puedan aprender a ganar NFT. Planeamos abrir un centro de recursos en el condado de Monterey para los jóvenes y proporcionar gafas de realidad virtual para acceder al Metaverso. Si los estudiantes están interesados en unirse al programa, les proporcionaremos becas en las que aprenderán a comprar y vender su primera NFT. También se les enseñará a manejar la tecnología blockchain.

California ha sido el corazón de la tecnología durante décadas. Esto se debe, en gran parte, a la fuerza de nuestros académicos, de nuestra mano de obra y del gobierno que crea políticas para impulsar la innovación. Desde nuestros funcionarios electos del estado, hasta nuestras ciudades locales, debemos impulsar políticas que no sólo estimulen la innovación, sino también la inclusión y la equidad. Debemos dar prioridad a las comunidades marginadas que tradicionalmente no han tenido acceso a la tecnología para que también puedan participar en la revolución de la Web 3.0.

A medida que esta tecnología vaya avanzando, habrá más puestos de trabajo disponibles para aquellos que sepan utilizarla. Nuestras escuelas y nuestros funcionarios electos deberían centrarse en la criptomoneda, la tecnología blockchain y el metaverso para garantizar que estas nuevas tecnologías se enseñan a nuestros jóvenes, de modo que podamos construir una vía para las futuras oportunidades laborales. El momento de hacerlo es ahora, ya que estos espacios se están desarrollando rápidamente, para garantizar que los californianos no se queden atrás.

Para mí, esto es personal. Siendo proactiva, construyendo mi propia comunidad metaversa y enseñando lo que sé a la siguiente generación, sé que estoy haciendo todo lo que puedo para garantizar que las niñas que se parecen a mí tengan que estar solas en menos salas en el futuro.";{'uri': 'laopinion.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'La Opinión Digital'}
87;;"Duhaime, who suffered minor injuries to his hand, said the event was 'a very traumatic thing' and that he 'did not stage this, in no shape or form'

The victim of a recent Northeastern University bombing has denied claims that he staged the explosion, noting the event was 'a very traumatic thing.'

Jason Duhaime, 45, an employee at the university's virtual reality lab, received skepticism from investigators after they said wounds on his hand were not consistent with an explosion, according to the Boston Globe.

Other officials said Duhaime was inconsistent with his story about the event when he relayed it to police.

'I did not stage this, in no way shape or form,' he said. 'They need to catch the guy that did this.'

One Boston firefighter who responded to the 'weird' incident told the Globe that there were no reports of 'a loud explosion.'

'It wasn't like a loud explosion,' he said. 'There were kids (still) in the classroom, so they must not have heard it. People did not seem panicked at all.

'You hear (the word) explosion, you think: big noise and people would be nervous.'

Jason Duhaime, 45, is an employee at Northeastern University's virtual reality lab. He suffered minor injuries to his hand after an explosion detonated from a package he opened Tuesday

Theories that the explosion may have been targeted toward Northeastern University Virtual Reality emerged on social media just hours after the incident

Investigation into Duhaime continues after officials say his injuries are not consistent with an explosion and that he has been inconsistent with his story of the event

Northeastern University said the package, which exploded at 7.18pm on Tuesday night, had been delivered to campus and detonated after being opened by Duhaime

A second package was neutralized by Boston's bomb squad shortly after the incident Tuesday at the Museum of Fine Arts, located close to campus, but was determined to be safe.

The staff member claimed he opened a hard plastic package inside Holmes Hall just after 7pm.

Officials found a one-paged, 'rambling' letter that had been included with the package which mentioned Mark Zuckerberg, the metaverse and virtual reality while indicating more bombs were coming.

As the dust settled, authorities revealed the box which exploded was a Pelican brand box - a plastic carrying case which can be pressurized and sealed shut - which had depressurized when the Duhaime opened it and caused his injuries.

Duhaime continued to defend his innocence.

'It's a very traumatic thing that has occurred so (I'm) shaken up, I'm not doing so good,' he said.

'I love the college. I've worked there for eight years and supported faculty and students. This is crazy. I cannot believe people are spreading rumors about this.'

Holmes Hall houses the Women's Gender and Sexuality Studies program, the journalism department and the campus Virtual Reality club, according to Twitter users

A Pelican case is a hard often waterproof black case with a soft inner lining typically used to transport delicate items

Pelican boxes are commonly used to store delicate devices like electronics or cameras, and would be commonplace in a virtual reality lab. On the front page of Northeastern's Experiential Technology Lab's website there is even a photo with a Pelican-style box visible in the background.

Authorities later determined the box which exploded had no traces of explosives on it, and had not been sent through the US Post Office.

Multiple sources have confirmed that there was some kind of a letter involved in the incident, including CNN's Chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, John Miller, who said he saw it.

'There was a note, there were pictures, the note was talking about virtual reality, talking about universities, talking about Mark Zuckerberg,' said Miller. 'The note is somewhat rambling, and they're trying to work through the meaning of it.'

The bombing left students and school faculty across the city unsettled, with Harvard and MIT both increasing their security after the incident.";{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}
88;;"Afirma José García Elohim que la suya es la primera exposición del mundo en el metaverso (universo virtual) que hace un artista plástico trasladando sus obras del formato tradicional, ""hechas con mis manos"", al digital. ""Y lo aseguro con rotundidad porque he investigado sobre este tema. Lo que hay son exposiciones en el metaverso realizadas por artistas digitales. La galería de arte Sotheby's, por ejemplo, ha creado una galería virtual, pero con obras de artistas digitales. En el mundo actual, en el que todo queda registrado en internet, no he encontrado ninguna referencia a un artista plástico que haya hecho lo mismo que yo"".

Medios como El Confidencial o El Español se han hecho eco del trabajo de este pontevedrés, que acaba de inaugurar La gran revelación en la plataforma Koonstel, especializada en proyectos tecnológicos y networking empresarial.

""Esta exposición viene precedida de dos experiencias anteriores: una exposición física y su versión en realidad virtual que, a través de unas gafas, permitía ver en movimiento toda la energía de las pinturas"". La exposición física era La iluminación del ser y tuvo lugar, a comienzos de año, en el IVigo Bussiness Space. Su versión virtual fue Metaverso cósmico, ""una evolución de la anterior, que se hizo en una galería de arte"".

89;;"Italian fashion and design school Istituto Marangoni made its Middle Eastern debut in Dubai with a unique talent show took place simultaneously at The Museum of the Future and in the metaverse.

Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Chairperson of Dubai Culture and Arts Authority (Dubai Culture) and Member of the Dubai Council, attended the show at the Museum of the Future (MOTF) and in the metaverse.

The innovative concept blended the physical fashion show at the MOTF with digital catwalks in the metaverse, showcasing the creations of five top students of Istituto Marangoni fashion design courses. Located in Gate 8 at the Dubai International Financial Centre, Istituto Marangoni Dubai offers undergraduate and professional courses in Fashion, Interior Design, Product Design and Visual Design.

Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed said: ""Istituto Marangoni's Dubai branch is a valuable addition to the city's rapidly developing creative and cultural landscape. Its diverse offering will provide creatives in Dubai and the region with the right tools to launch their design careers.""

Sheikha Latifa added that Dubai had consolidated its status as a global hub for design, one of the primary goals of the Dubai Creative Economy Strategy launched last year by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. In line with the strategy, Dubai Culture works to strengthen the education in the creative fields and, in turn, support the emergence of creative talents within the industry while establishing an ecosystem of creators in the emirate.

""Bringing global institutions with decades of experience in the field of design to the region reinforces our commitment to the sector and to being a cultural and creative hub. We look forward to the incredible talent that will graduate from the Dubai-based institute in the forthcoming years,"" said Sheikha Latifa.

Noura bint Mohammed Al Kaabi, Minister of Culture and Youth, said: ""It gives me great joy to welcome a globally renowned fashion and design school to Dubai. I see a great partnership in the making where the UAE and other MENA countries will have the advantage of a world-class design school while Istituto Marangoni will benefit from the untapped talent waiting to be harnessed.""

She added: ""The UAE is making waves in the creative space and building an ecosystem for future generations to contribute effectively to the creative economy. We are focusing on developing our cultural and creative industries to make them a more significant part of the UAE's economy. We believe nurturing talent is critical to developing the creative sector, and Istituto Marangoni will play an important role in achieving that. Imparting world-class education and specialised skills to our youth will boost their creative energy and support emerging talent.""

Stefania Valenti, managing director of Istituto Marangoni, said it's an honour to celebrate the opening of Istituto Marangoni Dubai at the Museum of the Future.

""Today's event showcases what Istituto Marangoni students can achieve. With the opening of our school in Dubai, we are offering local aspiring fashion and interior designers the opportunity to acquire the skills and knowledge required to kickstart their careers. We hope to contribute to fostering a new generation of fashion designers in the region, with special attention to empowering women in their aspirational field of interest, be it fashion, design or arts,"" said Valenti.

With this launch, Dubai joins the ranks of other world fashion capitals, including Milano, Firenze, Paris, London, Mumbai, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Miami, that host an Istituto Marangoni school. Valenti said that with qualified professional staff from Italy and an innovative ""learning by doing"" approach, students at Istituto Marangoni Dubai will gain the skills to translate their passion and talent into successful careers.

92;;"DUBAI: A ""Global Alliance on Green Economy"" was launched at the 8th World Green Economy Summit, which concluded in Dubai.

The summit was held under the theme ""Climate action leadership through collaboration: The roadmap to net-zero."" A large number of ministers, experts, decision-makers, officials, representatives of institutions, and the academic community from around the world took part in the summit.

The alliance aims to build a coalition of countries, prioritizing a green economy in the context of climate action and sustainable development, to enhance the capacity of developing countries, provide support for their green economy transition projects and exchange knowledge on implementation.

""If we want to fast-track our transition to a green economy, we must all work together, and to do so, we need one platform with one common objective. The UAE Global Alliance on Green Economy seeks to provide such a platform,"" said Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, UAE minister of climate change and environment.

Bet on tech

The UAE, which already boasts the world's tallest skyscraper and has launched a bold Mars mission, now hopes to become a pioneer in the depths of the metaverse.

In a project launched at Dubai's gleaming Museum of the Future, it announced that the UAE's Economy Ministry was setting up shop inside the immersive virtual world that is now taking shape.

If we want to fast-track our transition to a green economy, we must all work together.

Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, UAE minister of climate change and environment

Those who don their virtual reality goggles or use other means to venture within will find a ministry open for business with companies and even ready to sign bilateral agreements with foreign governments, officials said.

The metaverse is an online world where users will eventually be able to game, work and study, its proponents say -- although it is still in a ""test"" phase, the UAE's economy minister conceded.

Abdulla bin Touq Al-Marri was speaking at the inaugural Dubai Metaverse Assembly, held at the museum whose innovative ring shape decorated with Arabic calligraphy flanks the city's main thoroughfare.

Representatives of tech giants mingled with entrepreneurs and developers exploring the potential of the metaverse, a network of digital spaces intended as an extension of the physical world.

DFM adopts new methodology

Dubai Financial Market said on Monday it planned to adopt a new methodology for its main equities indices, which will come into effect in the fourth quarter, according to Reuters.

The Dubai bourse's general index, Shariah index and sector indices, will be calculated by S&P Dow Jones Indices, it said in a statement.

A key improvement among the changes is a limit on the weighting of a listed company to 10 percent from 20 percent, which should result in a larger representation of companies on the DFM's benchmarks, it said.

The Dubai bourse said the index calculation will be based on actual free float adjusted market capitalization, and that the indices will be rebalanced on a quarterly basis, from semi-annually currently.

The bourse plans to align its sectors with an industry classification standard which is followed by institutional clients, it said.

DFM will have seven sectors: Financials, industrials, real estate, utilities, communication services, materials and consumer staples.

The bourse has invited market participants for consultations on the index methodology ahead of possible changes, with the revised indexes to be launched in Q4, it said.";{'uri': 'arabnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Arab News'}

94;;"Pintó una Coca-Cola antes que Warhol, fue pionero en convertir su vida en una obra de arte y en colaborar con informáticos, se batió en un duelo de pintura con una computadora décadas antes de que apareciera el arte digital y afirmaba que ""la pintura será cibernética o no será"". Visionario y clarividente, Salvador Dalí se sintió atraído por las ciencias y la tecnología a lo largo de toda su vida y la Máquina de soñar, un dibujo de la serie Predicciones de Dalí, que expuso en 1957 en la galería Carstairs de Nueva York, constituye un claro antecedente de la realidad virtual. Todas las obsesiones científicas de Dalí, artista polifacético donde los haya, se plasman en Dalí cibernético, la nueva apuesta, la más ambiciosa desde su apertura hace tres años, del Centro de Artes Digitales Ideal de Barcelona, que con su programación atípica consiguió mantenerse activo y lleno (si bien al 50% del aforo) también en los días más oscuros de la pandemia.

Con Dalí cibernético, el Ideal se apunta varios tantos. Ha conseguido que la Fundación Dalí, siempre muy reticente a permitir el uso de la obra del pintor ampurdanés, concediera intervenir más de 150 obras, con la única condición de que en algún momento aparecieran en su forma integra. ""Conseguir el permiso para deconstruir, transformar y animar las piezas de un artista tan protegido como Dalí ha sido un verdadero logro"", asegura el director del centro, Jordi Sellas, que ha contado con la estrecha colaboración y supervisión del Centro de Estudios Dalinianos y de la directora de los museos Dalí, Montse Aguer. Desde el punto de vista tecnológico han sido necesarios 1,2 millones de euros y la colaboración de los estudios más punteros en los diversos campos de las nuevas tecnologías, para convertir el universo onírico de Dalí en un espacio inmersivo e interactivo, suspendido entre realidad y ficción.

Antes de entregarse a la experiencia tecnológica se pueden disfrutar algunas joyas: una película rodada en Nueva York en 1965 en la que Dalí habla de la cibernética, otra con las entrevistas realizadas en París unos años más tarde y recogidas en el libro El Gran Masturbador y el vídeo en el que compite con una computadora pintando a la actriz Rachel Welch.

Dalí habla de los retos de la óptica, la física nuclear, la mecánica cuántica, la teoría de las catástrofes, la geometría sagrada, la cuarta dimensión y el ADN como prueba de nuestra inmortalidad. ""Antes que las tablas de Moisés, la ley ya estaba contenida en los códigos de las espirales genéticas"", decía el artista que, en su peculiar inglés, no dudaba en afirmar: ""Yo soy el verdadero inventor de la cibernética"".

Aquella experiencia inmersiva que Dalí ya buscaba en el teatro-museo, inaugurado en Figueres en 1974, se plasma en la sala inmersiva, donde durante media hora el espectador se encuentra completamente sumergido en un tsunami de píxeles. La pieza incluye tres minutos generados por inteligencia artificial. ""Son imágenes creadas por la máquina, algo que Dalí preconizó hace más de 40 años"", explica Sellas. También se puede ver el holograma del músico Alice Cooper con los colores ácidos de los años 70 y, decorada con los elementos típicos del universo daliniano, una reproducción XXL de la Princesa cibernética de 1974, inspirada en la momia de la princesa china, custodiada por el famoso ejército de terracota, aunque Dalí la vistió con un traje de circuitos eléctricos, en vez de placas de jade.

El momento álgido llega con el metaverso, donde gracias a unas gafas de realidad virtual de última generación el visitante se convierte en un buzo ataviado con un escafandro vintage y subido a un barco fantasmal, cuyo mascarón de proa es Gala desnuda. Durante 12 minutos el público se encuentra rodeado por un torbellino de elementos dalinianos: elefantes de piernas interminables, hormigas famélicas, paredes que se desmoronan y se reconstruyen, enjambres de luciérnagas, un huevo gigante transitable, planetas que se transforman en medusas y una luna que se convierte en un huevo y luego en un sol. La experiencia es tan intensa que más de un visitante termina sobrecogido (algunos hasta mareados) por la falta de referencias espaciales y lo novedoso de la sensación. ""Es la primera vez en el mundo que se crea un metaverso al cual pueden acceder 40 personas a la vez para disfrutar de forma individual y colectiva de un espacio digital en constante evolución"", indica Sellas.

Si las precedentes propuestas del Ideal, dedicadas a Gustav Klimt y Frida Kahlo, tuvieron éxito, esta promete batir récords. El día de la inauguración, más de 15.000 personas ya habían adquirido su entrada y veinte ciudades se habían puesto en la cola para recibir el montaje en los próximos cuatro años, empezando por Londres, Estambul y Buenos Aires, seguidas por Zúrich, Múnich, Torino, Roma, Colonia, París, Bristol, Dublín, Valencia y Bilbao, entre otras.

Simultáneamente la Fundación Dalí ha concedido otra licencia a la empresa ArtDidaktik para desarrollar un proyecto expositivo de corte didáctico que relata la trayectoria personal y profesional del pintor a través de 160 obras en formato digital. Desafío Dalí, que estará instalada del 8 de octubre al 7 de marzo en el recinto ferial Ifema de Madrid, plantea un viaje sensorial y multimedia por la obra del artista con técnicas de realidad virtual y aumentada, cajas de luz y muchas pantallas. En este caso ha sido la Fundación Dalí la responsable de seleccionar las 160 obras que componen la muestra, cuyos originales se encuentran repartidos en más de 20 museos y colecciones privadas de todo el mundo.";{'uri': 'elpais.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'EL PAÍS'}

De acuerdo con datos publicados por la consultora internacional McKinsey & Company, el metaverso podrá generar hasta 5 billones de dólares para el año 2030. A partir de su potencial, empresas de distintas industrias se están involucrando en este espacio, con el objetivo de brindar experiencias allí.

Una de los sectores que tiene potencial para desarrollarse en ese ámbito es el diseño. Por eso, un estudio argentino ha lanzado su propia línea de NFT y una tienda online para ofrecer sus obras. Se trata de la compañía tucumana Mercedes Costal Prints & Patterns.

La empresa, que se dedica a la creación, producción y venta de wallpapers, pretende ser referencia y sentar un precedente en el mercado de las ilustraciones y la cultura digital. Uno de los caminos que eligió para lograrlo fue la introducción de esta plataforma en la que los clientes pueden adquirir productos virtuales.

De hecho, además de la oportunidad comprar y vender distintas piezas, este espacio permite que clientes y artistas interactúen y compartan distintas experiencias: más allá de lo comercial, desde el estudio indican que su mirada está puesta en un futuro en el que tanto la tecnología como el diseño y lo artesanal aportan conocimientos y visiones para un mundo compartido.

La compañía viene trabajando en el ámbito blockchain desde hace un tiempo. Por eso, ha sido una de las representantes nacionales en el London Design Festival, que se llevó a cabo el mes pasado en la capital del Reino Unido, y se sumó a la propuesta ""Experiencia creativa: de Argentina para el mundo"", impulsada por la Cancillería.

Con el objetivo de posicionar e insertar el trabajo que hacen las empresas de este país, la muestra que se realizó en la residencia oficial del embajador Javier Figueroa se enfocó en la creatividad para desarrollar soluciones en el contexto de los actuales problemas sociales y ambientales.

Entre los distintos productos y diseños que se presentaron allí, hubo lugar para las experiencias inmersivas como las que brinda Mercedes Costal. La compañía eligió participar con su icónico mural El Descanso de las Garzas: un recorte de los humedales del Litoral argentino en el que es posible interactuar con la flora y la fauna del lugar a través de un viaje en realidad aumentada.

Desde la compañía explican que esta plataforma no solamente entrega un viaje virtual, sino que también pretende posicionar el diseño y las ilustraciones en el mercado virtual. Por eso, el estudio complementa su oferta en el metaverso con su galería de NFT, en donde comercializa sus piezas.

En este marco y para dar a conocer todo el proceso orgánico y creativo que hay detrás de sus trabajos, la compañía presentó el libro ""Mercedes Costal, retrato de un atelier"". Allí, además, busca transmitir su identidad basada en un futuro armonioso entre la naturaleza y el ser humano.

Hoy, con tanto avance de la digitalización, ya no se puede pensar en el arte solo como una obra que se aprecia en un museo. En la actualidad, propuestas como Mercedes Costal le permiten a la gente sumergirse en creaciones de realidad virtual o recorrer una galería en el metaverso.

At the close of the event, DFF announced that the Dubai Metaverse Assembly would return on the 11 and 12 of October 2023 in a bigger and more immersive experience after achieving outstanding success in its first year.

It comes after the flagship event welcomed over 600 experts from the tech industry, witnessed 25 main and side sessions and hosted 30 speakers and 40 tech companies. Additionally, 40,000 tuned in virtually through online streaming and the metaverse technology, offering individuals and government entities a unique immersive experience.

Over two days, more than 15 initiatives and strategies were launched during the Dubai Metaverse Assembly, which took place at the Museum of the Future and AREA 2071, Emirates Tower.

On the second day, His Excellency Gabriel Abed, Ambassador of Barbados to the United Arab Emirates, announced that the island-nation was entering the metaverse with a new virtual embassy. ""Our metaverse embassy will create diplomatic parity for Barbados,"" he said. ""It will empower developing nations to gain diplomatic representation at the same level as larger nations, without vast budgets or infrastructure.""

Sandeep Nailwal Co-Founder of Dubai-based cryptocurrency platform Polygon, valued at USD 25 billion, announced plans to help decentralized technology firms go green and offer energy-efficient - even carbon-neutral - experiences in the metaverse. With most of the company's senior management now headquartered in Dubai, Nailwal promised to ""drive the industry forward toward sustainability.""

Ziad Traboulsi, Global Director, Business Engineering, Reality Labs, Meta, revealed the California-headquartered technology company believed its family of apps, Facebook and Instagram, would be a ""bridge"" for people to enter immersive worlds.

The state's role in governing virtual worlds was keenly debated on the second day's first panel. Participants included Christian Kunz, Head of Senior Vice President - Strategy, Dubai International Financial Center; Alexander Chehade, Executive Director and General Manager, Binance Dubai; Keith Jordan, VP of Innovation, Mastercard; Vinit Shah, Senior Advisor, Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority; and Catherine Zhou, Group Head of Ventures, Digital Partnerships, and Innovation, HSBC.

Whether through the launch of NFTs or by offering new immersive experiences, Emirates will allow millions of people to enjoy its in-flight hospitality virtually, the airline's Chief Operating Officer, Adel Al Redha, said. He also revealed the carrier planned to hire 4,000 cabin crew by mid-2023 and train them in the metaverse.

A panel session on the metaverse's real-world impact drew the participation of Yusuf Bahadir, Chief Technology Officer, GoArt; Vishal Gondal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, GOQii; David Clark-Joseph, Vice President of Investments, Pixelynx; and Bradford Bird, Head of Partnerships and Collaborations, The Fabricant.

Homegrown Emirati companies testing new experiences for the metaverse joined a panel to shed light on how local entrepreneurs were building new digital worlds. The panelists included Amin Al Zarouni, CEO, Bedu; Abdulla Mohamed Al Dhaheri, Deputy Managing Director and Partner, Chaintech Labs; Haya Al Gussain, Founder & CEO, Evolve Network Club; and Abdel Rahman Al Suweidi, CEO, MetaCon Global.

Highlighting how blockchain and web 3.0 technologies can spark an evolution in gaming, Sarah Buxton, Chief Operating Officer of Gala Games, said: ""We are still at the beginning of our journey, and you know this when the biggest use cases for blockchain are from the banking and the professional services sector.""

Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) gaming has become ubiquitous in entertainment, providing gamers with close to real-life experiences, but Ahmed Tehemar Gamefi, BNB Chain, suggested there would be winners and losers. ""We now have a lot of metaverses popping up in the gaming industry; in the future we will understand which ones will go on to host the most users,"" he said.

In a pre-recorded address, Sebastian Borget, Chief Operating Officer and Co-Founder, The Sandbox, said gaming on decentralized platforms would allow players to create their own personal, immersive experiences.

97;;"The whole concept of ""reality"" has always fascinated me and zillions of others. Many moons ago (that's generational speak for ""a long time ago""), I eagerly gobbled up an evening philosophy course at what is now St. Joseph's University in my hometown of Philadelphia. The instructor was a popular one whose late-night classes were always filled and whose students, working men and women, crowded around his desk after class to continue discussion of subjects he brought to life, like -- well -- reality.

In those years, the subject was a philosophical football to be played with for hours and used as the basis of term papers. You could have fun with the term because everybody knew what was real, and, more importantly, what wasn't. The term itself was never in question.

That was then. Now, enter ""Virtual Reality"" and ""Augmented Reality"" and all of their sub-types. The concepts have infiltrated our language, our television shows, our advertisements, and yes, our lives - like it or not.

Rod Serling, creator of the vintage television series ""Twilight Zone,"" would be hard put today to create a series that exceeds what our ""normal"" is becoming. I particularly remember an episode in which a man continually visited a museum to view a particular landscape painting he loved, and at the conclusion, escaped from police by entering the painting and disappearing. We now have the opportunity to do pretty much the same thing with the right equipment.

Google defines Virtual Reality as ""a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings. This environment is perceived through a device known as a Virtual Reality headset or helmet."" An aside: Back in the day, it was not uncommon for young people to have to take certain drugs to achieve a similar experience. A whole book series by the late anthropologist Carlos Castaneda about shaman training, which included stories of ingesting certain herbs and the ""trips"" the participant took, sold wildly -- some eight million copies -- and was published in 17 languages.

But I digress. The core thing for us to know is that today, right here in 2022, we can enter into a fictional ""reality"" without drugs. You even can buy (expensive) property in what is known as the ""Metaverse."" There is a whole lexicon for virtual reality and its attendant subjects, such as cryptocurrency, which is the digital money used in virtual reality transactions. I know. You've already heard too much. But, gentle reader, bear with me a bit longer as I cleverly knit this information into the whole concept of reality.

Decades ago, you might never have been able to buy items such as artwork and real estate. But now, once upon this very present moment, you can buy such things in a virtual world using a non-fungible token (NFT), which is a form of digital currency. (You can read about these currency terms on ""Investopedia.com,"" which gives as clear a description as I've seen.) For example, you can buy property in the United States or other countries on Tiliaverse.com, from as little as $200 up to more than $8,000. The site also provides information about the concept of such ownership. To my mind, this is the game of Monopoly brought to the big screen; but, instead of playing it, you play in it.

Lastly, we can't forget the proliferation of ""reality shows"" on television. I think it's fair to suggest that the term is an oxymoron, as are all the other ""realities."" The words ""virtual"" and ""reality"" cancel each other out, which I believe brings us back to the basics -- either something is ""real,"" or it is ""virtual,"" but it can't be both, which is not to say that people can't believe it's both (but that's a whole other area of study, isn't it?).

The late science fiction writer Philip K. Dick said that, ""Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."" I believe that's as good a definition as any for the concept, which is not to say you can't have some fun along the way by stretching it. Just do not pass ""Go"" and do not collect $200.

Ziad Traboulsi, Global Director, Business Engineering, Reality Labs, Meta, revealed the California-headquartered technology company believed its family of apps, Facebook and Instagram, would be a ""bridge"" for people to enter immersive worlds.

The state's role in governing virtual worlds was keenly debated on the second day's first panel. Participants included Christian Kunz, Head of Senior Vice President - Strategy, Dubai International Financial Center; Alexander Chehade, Executive Director and General Manager, Binance Dubai; Keith Jordan, VP of Innovation, Mastercard; Vinit Shah, Senior Advisor, Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority; and Catherine Zhou, Group Head of Ventures, Digital Partnerships, and Innovation, HSBC.

Whether through the launch of NFTs or by offering new immersive experiences, Emirates will allow millions of people to enjoy its in-flight hospitality virtually, the airline's Chief Operating Officer, Adel Al Redha, said. He also revealed the carrier planned to hire 4,000 cabin crew by mid-2023 and train them in the metaverse.

A panel session on the metaverse's real-world impact drew the participation of Yusuf Bahadir, Chief Technology Officer, GoArt; Vishal Gondal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, GOQii; David Clark-Joseph, Vice President of Investments, Pixelynx; and Bradford Bird, Head of Partnerships and Collaborations, The Fabricant.

Highlighting how blockchain and web 3.0 technologies can spark an evolution in gaming, Sarah Buxton, Chief Operating Officer of Gala Games, said: ""We are still at the beginning of our journey, and you know this when the biggest use cases for blockchain are from the banking and the professional services sector.""

Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) gaming has become ubiquitous in entertainment, providing gamers with close to real-life experiences, but Ahmed Tehemar Gamefi, BNB Chain, suggested there would be winners and losers. ""We now have a lot of metaverses popping up in the gaming industry; in the future we will understand which ones will go on to host the most users,"" he said.

In a pre-recorded address, Sebastian Borget, Chief Operating Officer and Co-Founder, The Sandbox, said gaming on decentralized platforms would allow players to create their own personal, immersive experiences.
